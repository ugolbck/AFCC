27,rhythm games are not my sort of thing that is why i found myself surprised to be enjoying this game so much the main advantage that this game has over its competitors is a good story with gameplay features borrowed from professor layton and extremely catchy beats i found myself humming the tunes from this fairly shortly after playing it for the first time.the plot of the game is focused around a young frenchman called raphael who goes around by night disguised as the notorious phantom r an art thief of great style and sophistication the police are baffled at the ability of this young redheaded thief in a fashionable suit and fedora to disappear undoubtedly they asked the random redheaded civilian with glasses and no hat for information but he did not see anything it is that kind of game raphael is searching for his father who went missing years before during his pursuit he finds himself entwined in the risen emperor napoleon's dastardly plans to take over the world fortunately his men are susceptible to timed dance moves.sound ridiculous good it is meant to the plot is one of the most entertaining things about this game amusing and insane it takes our heroes on a tour of paris and its environs and paris is very much on display here the city looks gorgeous even in the 2d that dominates the gameplay when you do get to see a cinematic cutscene in glorious 3d no less it really sours.the rhythm games are cleverly based around this plot for example when sneaking into the louvre you have to follow a beat to hide behind convenient statues and avoid the guards when fighting napoleon's men you have to punch them as they bounce at you in synchronized fashion when eluding policemen on roller skates you have to jump or duck to avoid capture and my personal favorite you get to defend yourself against your archrival's pi child charlie who attempts to apprehend you by kicking a flaming football at your face they are all fun not a little bit silly and have a catchy beat.the parts of the game not revolving around playing rhythm games owe a very large debt to professor layton not so much the puzzle aspect but the way that you move your character along a map and use the touchscreen to interact with the characters and scenery on it they even have playcoins you can collect by tapping random areas of the screen the character and street designs are very nice these are seen at their full effect when the cutscenes start these cutscenes are beautifully animated and really capture a spirit of adventure i wish they would make this into an anime so we could see it all animated the 3d is used to good effect in these especially the first cutscene which has raphael dancing around a room filled with chandeliers the rest of the game does not use it much and it is often easier to just turn it off.most of this game takes place on the bottom screen the top screen has a map and is used for all the wonderful 3d cutscenes but when traveling you pay attention to the touchscreen in battles the top screen becomes important these battles alternate between having you tap buttons on the bottom screen with your stylus and hitting buttons no you do not have to do both at the same time that would be horrifyingly difficult.the downsides to the game are fairly minor but annoying the rating system is messed up the game does not record your best scores only an average of all your scores this means that if you want the game to save you getting an a-rank score you have to get it right on your first time which is almost impossible another flaw is the grading system for these ranks it is too heavily focused on what your last move was you can get a perfect score right up until the end and then flub only the last note dropping you down to a c-rank it is very irritating.if any of this sounds compelling try the demo it is available for free on the nintendo store this is one fun game even for non rhythm game fans while the game does not always add up to the sum of its parts nevertheless it provides a fun ride.do store this is one fun game even for non rhythm game fans while the game does not always add up to the sum of its parts nevertheless it

92,i have been using bitdefender for the past couple of years i found the two thousand and eight version for three computers for two years at a great price when it was running out i went looking for a similar deal and found one i noticed a couple of unpolished elements when installing there were a lot of dos command prompt windows opening in the background on the screen very briefly i did not have to interact with any of them and they went away almost immediately so there is no harm to it it is just a little unpolished i should also mention that the update for it is big it will ask to download the updated installer then after a few minutes when that is downloaded and run the updates for the program are currently over seventy-five mb i think that is probably the case with many anti-virus programs but just be aware if you are on dial-up you will be downloading for quite some time i uninstalled that old from a laptop and a desktop the desktop went fine but the laptop failed to uninstall i tried to get the uninstall program off bitdefender's website but the link they pointed to was dead eventually i found the cd and reinstalled which failed but the cd had the uninstaller which worked i only mention this because it is a little worrisome that if the last program had those issues that this version might when i eventually uninstall it i like this version of the program it has several different modes ranging from novice hides settings to expert showing all of it and is very easy to change between them my absolute favorite part though is the you are not fully protected system in past programs i have used if you disable some feature you constantly get the little alert icon that you are at risk bitdefender two thousand and ten lets you choose which of those things it monitors for so i did not want the anti-spam because i only use web mail so i told it not to bother me that i would deleted it it may be a small thing but to me it is a huge annoyance saver.so far i cannot tell if the scanner is faster or not it scans at only about a quarter of the number of files per second as the old program but it supposedly has an intelligent monitoring system which lets it avoid rescanning files that have not changed and thus could not have picked up an infection so while it was not that fast on the first scan in theory it will only get faster moving forward it intentionally skipped thousands of files.default is a daily scan which in my opinion is complete overkill unless you have a kid in your house if the resident protection is running all the time you can get by with once or twice a week thankfully the scheduling is very easy and you can even set the scans to take low priority which is a nice touch.in terms of detection bitdefender is not the highest rated scanner but it is far from the lowest it is an excellent budget anti-virus package and more than adequate for most people's needs considering how reasonable the pricing is i would happily recommend however since i have only used it a week or so if it does do anything really weird i will update my review to mention it.update 8/ 3/10- finally had to use my printer and guess what bitdefender has killed it

106,my friend wanted a digital camera he was looking at still units but after he starting talking more about movies than stills i talked him into a video camera over a still camera this type of product has been out for awhile but most of them have been primitive needed tons of light and the videos were of generally low quality i have canon slr units their digital sensors are some of the best in my opinion so i started checking out this camera most consumer sites have glowing review after glowing review on the fs100 we have had this unit about three months we have used it quite a lot under mostly daylight conditions where these units most often fall down is in the amount of light they need to get good pictures my old tape camcorder can easily get good video in candle light this one is not quite that good but it is dang close most often with these units low light means unacceptably grainy images ... this unit does pretty well with that from what i have seen at least in middle quality mode the book states minimum light something like one hundred lux which is around dim room light after i got this i took it to the target parking lot at night and shot some video under just the parking lot mercury lamps ... i was looking for two things ... grainy images and color shifts caused by the non-daylight colored lamps in the parking area lighting i happened to catch a guy riding across the parking lot on his bike at a pretty good clip and tested the camera by tracking him across the lot and zooming in and out all the while ... the image was a bit grainy but it was acceptable and surprisingly good for a camera of this variety at night and under non daylight colored light ... i e canon's sensor is pretty darn good my first canon slr is pretty brain dead when it comes to mixed lighting situations but they seem to have straightened up their act in later products in that regard white balance logic there is a competing product of this type made by samsung the price isgenerally a bit lower than the canon i have looked at that unit but not had a chance to use one on that unit folks are saying the buttons are too flimsy another reason i went with this one we use this camera to shoot a lot of fast action sca heavy fighting i find that the default auto setting does not result in a fast enough shutter speed to catch very fast action this unit has a mode that allows you to choose the shutter speed while the camera chooses the aperature ... i fixed the blurred action by setting the camera shutter speed to 1/250 or faster and that has cured that issue completely i have not shot in full quality mode ... really do not need it ... middle quality mode is pretty darn good even displayed on a large flat panel although i am sure a true hd video snob would sniff indignantly at it this camera supports sdhd so you are not limited to two gig memory cards the sixteen gig cards are currently out like three hours in middle quality mode and thirty-two gig cards are also available but still too expensive if you get this camera i suggest you buy an image bank handheld self-powered device with notebook hard drive in it so you can clean off your cards and reuse them this camera does not have touch screen i really do not miss that at all the joystick is very serviceable i find the menus easy to navigate and the camera has a good variety of settings if i did not mention it before the camera can also take still images that are very acceptable overall what i think about it i like the camera i think if it was up to me i would redesign the zoom lever yes it is under your fingers as you hold the camera ... but i find it a little bit awkward especially when zooming in higher magnifications i would prefer to have the zoom on the back where i can hit it with my thumb canon does their usual thing of monopolizing batteries and accessories for this camera by not releasing tech specs so other companies can make products that work with it batteries are outrageous at eighty bucks plus each you can find them on amazon for around sixty but that is still outrageous in my book you can find knock off batteries on ebay that power the camera but they do not have the internal electronics and thus the camera cannot detect the charge and they will not charge on the camera one of your first purchases should be two sixteen gig sdhc cards they are not too high if you shop around four gig cards will suffice to start but get the biggest ones you can get and stick with a quality manufacturer as well i did not pick high speed cards for this camera i have not noticed lag caused because the camera buffers were full and could not write to the card fast enough ... at least not in mid quality mode ... high quality may be another issue what i am saying is i do not know if investing in the high speed memory cards is worth it for this item like it is for my professional slrs this is a great unit especially around the price that amazon has it for it is great to not have to digitize your movie you just pop out the card and play it with windows media player this unit also does not use any kind of custom format like some of the other cameras do it is stock mpeg two right off the camera so you do not have to translate it before windows can play it or roxio can burn it onto a cd dvd yes i would buy this again,3.0,1.0,PRP$ NN VBD DT JJ NN PRP VBD VBG IN RB

talk more about movie than still i talk he into a video camera over a still camera this type of product have be out for awhile but most of they have be primitive need ton of light and the video be of generally low quality i have canon slr unit they digital sensor be some of the best in my opinion so i start check out this camera most consumer site have glowing review after glowing review on the fs100 we have have this unit about three month we have use it quite a lot under mostly daylight condition where these unit most often fall down be in the amount of light they need to get good picture my old tape camcorder can easily get good video in candle light this one be not quite that good but it be dang close most often with these unit low light mean unacceptably grainy image ... this unit do pretty well with that from what i have see at least in middle quality mode the book state minimum light something like one hundred lux which be around dim room light after i get this i take it to the target parking lot at night and shoot some video under just the parking lot mercury lamp ... i be look for two thing ... grainy image and color shift cause by the non-daylight color lamp in the parking area lighting i happen to catch a guy ride across the parking lot on he bike at a pretty good clip and test the camera by track he across the lot and zoom in and out all the while ... the image be a bit grainy but it be acceptable and surprisingly good for a camera of this variety at night and under non daylight color light ... i e canon 's sensor be pretty darn good my first canon slr be pretty brain dead when it come to mixed lighting situation but they seem to have straighten up they act in later product in that regard white balance logic there be a compete product of this type make by samsung the price isgenerally a bit lower than the canon i have look at that unit but not have a chance to use one on that unit folk be say the button be too flimsy another reason i go with this one we use this camera to shoot a lot of fast action sca heavy fighting i find that the default auto setting do not result in a fast enough shutter speed to catch very fast action this unit have a mode that allow you to choose the shutter speed while the camera choose the aperature ... i fix the blur action by set the camera shutter speed to 1/250 or faster and that have cure that issue completely i have not shoot in full quality mode ... really do not need it ... middle quality mode be pretty darn good even display on a large flat panel although i be sure a true hd video snob would sniff indignantly at it this camera support sdhd so you be not limit to two gig memory card the sixteen gig card be currently out like three hour in middle quality mode and thirty-two gig card be also available but still too expensive if you get this camera i suggest you buy a image bank handheld self-powered device with notebook hard drive in it so you can clean off you card and reuse they this camera do not have touch screen i really do not miss that at all the joystick be very serviceable i find the menu easy to navigate and the camera have a good variety of setting if i do not mention it before the camera can also take still image that be very acceptable overall what i think about it i like the camera i think if it be up to I i would redesign the zoom lever yes it be under you finger as you hold the camera ... but i find it a little bit awkward especially when zoom in higher magnification i would prefer to have the zoom on the back where i can hit it with my thumb canon do they usual thing of monopolize battery and accessory for this camera by not release tech spec so other company can make product that work with it battery be outrageous at eighty buck plus each you can find they on amazon for around sixty but that be still outrageous in my book you can find knock off battery on ebay that power the camera but they do not have the internal electronics and thus the camera can not detect the charge and they will not charge on the camera one of you first purchase should be two sixteen gig sdhc card they be not too high if you shop around four gig card will suffice to start but get the biggest one you can get and stick with a quality manufacturer as well i do not pick high speed card for this camera i have not notice lag cause because the camera buffer be full and could not write to the card fast enough ... at least not in mid quality mode ... high quality may be another issue what i be say be i do not know if investing in the high speed memory card be worth it for this item like it be for my professional slr this be a great unit especially around the price that amazon have it for it be great to not have to digitize you movie you just pop out the card and play it with window media player this unit also do not use any kind of custom format like some of the other camera do it be stock mpeg two right off the camera so you do not have to translate it

140,i would have easily given this play food set five stars but for two details that bothered me with the wooden serving tray the first is that it is pictured both on amazon and on the box it came in as being solid wood it is not the bottom of the try is mdf that said it may be mdf created with e zero glues as i can detect absolutely no formaldehyde odor from it and i have a nose for vocs often much to my dismay the second detail is that there was a sharp shard of wood which had splintered up on the edge of the tray we glued it down with some elmer's time will tell if that holds it or if we will have to disfigure the tray by removing it and sanding it down however now that i have gotten those relatively minor gripes out of the way the rest of the set is pretty fantastic there are two main courses a veggie burger and a fish we are vegetarians so this is more food for the girls cats and bears and so forth which is something they really desired i might add both pieces cut into six and seven pieces respectively they are quite easy to cut and unlike many velcro-attached play foods the velcro is inlaid allowing the pieces to be flush with one another thus when the items are put together they look like whole solid pieces and do not just fall apart the veggie burger is finished with a durable chip-resistant matte paint stain and has grill imprints on one side the fish is unfinished wood and has grill imprints as well both are lovely the veggie burger can be adorned with a pat of butter the fish with a small slice of lemon these are not velcro attached the side dishes include four each of green beans fries and carrots these are are simple and easily-recognizable the fork and knife are natural wood with blue-stained handles and seem quite durable there is also an attractive thin cardboard insert with a lettuce bed and a few tomato slices which jazzes up the not-as-attractive-as-advertised mdf-bottomed serving tray sadly i am not convinced this piece will last very long as it is just too bendy but i suppose it would be easy enough to make your own variation to replace it the scale of the food is almost relative to our haba erzi and plan toys play food collection probably a wee bit larger but a wee bit smaller than something like melissa and doug nonetheless i could see it pleasing fans of both it does have the distinctive advantage over melissa and doug of no reeking of formaldehyde and other mystery chemicals and claims to have been processed in an ecologically sustainable and socially responsible manner bottom line no doubt i would buy this

173,"cyril scott 1879-1970 had the misfortune of too easy success early in his career and mounting neglect for the rest of his life from as early as one thousand , nine hundred and thirty he was being written off as an imitator of debussy who had nothing more worth saying does this adventurous cd confirm or refute this view though a lifelong lover of his music i have to confess that the muses scott's first mature symphony is like the curate's egg good in parts but unacceptable as a whole it starts well with a sinister and brooding opening movement but the middle movements are underdeveloped and the choral finale is a watered down version of the general dance at the end of ravel's daphnis and chloe the second piano concerto of one thousand , nine hundred and fifty-eight is representative of the far more individual idiom that scott developed when he returned to composing in the late 1940s the harmony has an acrid complexity the phrases are brief and there is none of the effortless note-spinning that led colin matthews to dismiss his earlier music as vapid unfortunately the work never establishes a convincing relationship between the soloist and the orchestra and is full of striking gestures that lead nowhere the recently recorded second string quartet played by archaeus quartet on the dutton label is a far more attractive example of his late style that leaves neptune which is a revised version of disaster at sea a long tone poem depicting the sinking of the titanic that was written in the late 1910s there was a tardy first performance in one thousand , nine hundred and thirty-three when the critics panned the work as mere film music scott responded by removing the more crudely programmatic parts of the score in a revised and renamed version of the work which was published in one thousand , nine hundred and thirty-five but has gone unperformed till now i am happy to hail it as a masterpiece the tragic atmosphere is sustained throughout and the writing is beautifully diaphanous and full of highly original orchestral effects which evoke the surge and the spray and the careering bulk of the doomed ship with uncanny vividness there is nothing finer in scott than the bleak epilogue depicting the bare and icy ocean as night sets in in the wake of the famous film and with the original title restored could not this work achieve a belated popularity certainly this skilfully crafted and richly sonorous recording makes the strongest possible case it and the neapolitan rhapsody available on a marco polo cd seem to me the two strongest

243,"the d70 is the digital slr to record daily life and life events with a six megapixel resolution limits the size of prints you can make with it to about eleven by seventeen if this is not a problem for you then this is your digital camera if you want to be able to make larger prints with good resolution then you need to spend a great deal more money for a higher resolution digital camera about 5,000 or stick with film i keep my old n90 for these purposes the d70 comes bundled with the excellent and compact 18-70 nikkor lens and one en-el three battery to get started with the camera i suggest the following in addition one extra en-el three lithium-ion battery two 2gb 80x compactflash cards with write acceleration wa technology one cf card reader for your computer firewire or usb connection depending upon your needs as time and money permit you may want to add the following a telephoto lens for wildlife and sporting events the 70-300 mm f4 -5.6 g af nikkor is a great value and complements the bundled lens nicely if money is not an object step up to the 70-300 ed or the 70-200 f2 eight with vibration reduction a good macro lens such as the af micro nikkor 105mm f2 eight polarizing filters for both the kit lens and the telephoto get nikon filters there is no sense in spending money for nikkor lenses and then putting junk filters on them a bag to carry all this stuff this will get you nicely started further down the line you may wish to get the following a speedlight either the sb six hundred or eight hundred a tripod and ballhead be sure to check prices at b h photo as well as those shown here they have a tremendous selection and have long been known and trusted by serious photographers in addition i would suggest that anyone who buys a d70 join nikonians

compact 18-70 nikkor lens and one en-el three battery to get start with the camera i suggest the follow in addition one extra en-el three lithium-ion battery two 2gb 80x compactflash card with write acceleration wa technology one cf card reader for you computer firewire or usb connection depend upon you need as time and money permit you may want to add the follow a telephoto lens for wildlife and sport event the 70-300 mm f4 -5.6 g af nikkor be a great value and complement the bundle lens nicely if money be not a object step up to the 70-300 ed or the 70-200 f2 eight with vibration reduction a good macro lens such as the af micro nikkor 105 mm f2 eight polarize filter for both the kit lens and the telephoto get nikon filter there be no sense in spend money for nikkor lens and then put junk

247,this game is a far better experience than any cod experiences in the past years where their games have become stale run and shoot experiences the combination of killzones cover system and intelligent enemy ai conveys a sense of military realism and challenge enemy's flank use grenades to flush you out of cover while allowing the player to feel like every kill and battle won was earned through precise positioning and strategy all of which equates to an impressive experience of depth despite the shallow and often times stereotypical narrative speaking of immersion playing this game with the playstation move and sharp shooter is a surreal experience it takes getting use to at first and my suggestion is to practice this scheme in the bot zone which is an offline simulated multi player mode this both allows you to calibrate the move scheme to your liking and at the same time allows you to get acclimated to the pacing and class system of the online multi player which has become my new addiction on its own right after playing through the campaign with a dual shock and than sharp shooter i am now an online fiend in cod if your not up to par with getting a high kill death ratio you are seemingly made useless and target practice by helicopters attack dogs and whatever cod mechanism that unbalances the online experience for us non aiming experts in killzone the class base system allows me to contribute to my team without having to be a terminator in one game i had the highest score dispite having one of the worst kdr of my team i was an engineer and medic taking up points fixing weapons depots and setting up gun turrets which did some killing for me and as a medic getting points healing people left and right when the battles around me became intense which was the norm in ever online match each match was highly competitive and never once made me feel like i could not get involved even with getting slaughtered by a mech which is easy to take down as anengineer fixing the wasp turrets to insure those huge mechs do not become too over powering balanced that is what this entire game feels from the difficulty in the story mode which has challenging ai but gives you powerful guns that never allow the task at hand feel just perfect for online is also a balanced experience with every class acting as checks and balances for each other provoking team success to rely on teams with class diversity and team work along with the best move implementation ever seen in a game just started testing it out online and my kdr is steadily improving as a result ... killzone three is the best fps i have had since the first modern warfare and not once have i even mentioned the obvious ... that this game has dethroned uncharted two and god

370,first things first i loved rainbow six and rogue spear i have also played operation flashpoint quite a bit gr is a combination of the three sort of the good the graphics are astounding enough said tutorial is good no bugs on my system.the bad realism is questionable sure the firefights seem real enough with tracers flying and damage and weapons are realistic however since when do green berets go on missions with one rifle and one secondary weapon answer never they go with seventy pounds of gear including rifles backup pistols several grenades and several types of grenades claymore mines night vision knives explosives radios etc etc they carry anywhere from 300-1000 or more rounds of ammo in gr you get one primary weapon e g m16 and one other thing pistol or explosive or binoculars or grenades but only one of these and you cannot mix and match items in the kit you can only choose from certain combinations e g rifleman use the m16 not m4 or mp5 demo guys use the m4 but not m16 etc second the selection of weapons is poor since when is an elite commando limited in his selection of weapons the second single-player mission is a hostage rescue you have got to rescue two guys from two locations about two hundred yards apart so my first thought was to use a silenced mp5 but it is not available even though they are standard weapons for specops soldiers instead you go with the m16 and when you shoot up one location the enemy elsewhere on the map will not even react or put up their guard in any way even though they would have heard the gunshots.third the friendly ai is pretty limited one reviewer called it user-friendly that is true but it is almost too simple and does not provide the flexibility necessary to simulation special operations warfare you cannot control formations stance or rules of engagement and even with the limited control available the soldiers pretty much suck no aitactics no reaction to the enemy no nothing even though they are supposed to be elite commandos.all in all i expected more from tom clancy and red storm this is basically rainbow six or rogue spear transplanted outside and called a tactical shooter combat sim a lot of potential

410,background i have two intel macs with aluminum and glass cases one a non-unibody twenty-four inch imac another a unibody 13.3- inch macbook pro they both have core two duo processors and so would not run mac os x 10.7 to a decent level of capability then i heard how apple was going to deprecate the mobileme that i willingly paid one hundred and eighty for so it could stay around for two years now apple is going to throw not just that pittance but the money i spent on three intel macs and a time capsule that did what i wanted to over three thousand out the window so i struck back and keep snow leopard configured in a pleasing manner i am smart about what i do on the internet and like the level of functionality i currently have and decided to supplement my snow leopard with windows seven what version of windows seven deserves to go on an intel mac for me the answer was simple the same version as what i have in snow leopard-not a single missing feature but not installed with objectionable updates which i do not want the mac app store and i do not want a windows app store either so i run windows seven ultimate on my two intel macs with the internet explorer nine and windows seven sp1 hidden and they will stay so as long as absolutely possible with that said here are my opinions of the various features one the new taskbar it kicks butt i had to download the windows seven rc over a 1.5 mbit dsl connection just to experience the new taskbar early and when i got opportunities i bought windows seven that so fat has been fully legal to avoid hassles and yes i know windows seven has windows genuine advantage but if that is going to be an issue i expect that microsoft will inform me of what to do about it the one problem i had was successfully dealt with and they answered another question most kindly my experience has been top notch probably because god gives me better luck i actually pray about things like this and so far god has not failed me two homegroup when all three windows seven computers are on and awake homegroup works perfectly for me i am most pleased with its performance three windows xp mode all three computers have an edition of windows seven that allows it although one does not support virtualization and the unassisted virtualization updater refuses to believe it is needed i use it for microsoft sam and will not be afraid to load applications into windows xp mode should i need them the 13.3- inch core two duo macbook pro has more audio garbling than the imac does the imac has almost none three bitlocker drive encryption i found one nice fellow who posted directions on a way to make bitlocker work without a tpm 1.2 or better chip and it allows me to have access to every feature i paid for i am most pleased with windows seven in that regard four language packs it helps having a laptop and desktop that if i need to can switch languages so i can help people who may need it i have not needed it so far five the geek factor i must say windows seven ultimate gives me great pride that i can have access to not just the basic set of features in home premium but that if someone has a problem with windows seven professional enterprise or ultimate i can help them the features that are also in windows seven professional which i have on an old intel cantrino santa rosa mobile technology former vista laptop that was bought well before the offer to get a free windows seven upgrade but that i used my student thirty offer for-i paid more to get extended download time and a dvd backup plus i got the thirty-two bit version which did not have the installation nightmare of the sixty-four bit version are also so good to have in the toolbox of available windows seven features i love out of the windows seven professional level features network aware printing i go to my aunt and uncle's ginormous house every now and then and my windows seven professional laptop and to be fair my windows seven ultimate macbook pro now too can simply go from the color and black and white laser printers here to my aunt anduncle's officejer j4580 and back again windows seven hoem premium is too little for my dual-cre windows seven computers although i will put it on my emachine-a w3622 with a single core celeron four hundred and twenty at 1.6 ghz and intel gma nine hundred and fifty barely aero-capable graphics plus i can have people who are having windows seven issues send to me for remote assistance and pull their computer up on my imac which has a big enough screen to help most people especially if they have laptops and i can if the problem is not fixable under remote assistance take my macbook pro and have a point of comparison on-site with me especially since i got windows seven from good to great discounts through ebay for windows seven ultimate and microsoft's student offer for windoes seven professional i feel like i got everything i needed for plenty fair enough prices i love the way three or more windows seven computers work with each other i truly do love it i guess i better end this review before i take an eternity plus i saw a commercial on tv that ran a fair amount last year showiing a computer at one person's home being accessed by a laptop that someone let them borrow the remote computer was displaying an aero desktop on the laptop windows vista even ultimate to the best of my knowledge could not do this so i investigated and after months of not knowing i found out that windows seven ultimate with the experience section maxed could do it but professional could not if you love the aero eye candy and especially love windows seven s improvements to it from vista that every bit as much as bitlocker and bitlocker to go or the language packs provided free make windows seven ultimate worth the money over even professional provided your hardware can give you something at least approaching an optimal experience in other words a bloomfield lynnfield clarksdale or arrandale or their sandy bridge successors for those who like them cpus or a core two duo quad or extreme with dedicated or nvidia integrated graphics will be just about perfect for windows seven ultimate and if it can have 5ghz 802.11 n wifi and bluetooth 2.1+ edr or better along with gigabit ethernet and maybe a tpm 1.2 or better chip as well then that is all the better but anyway especially with worthy hardware windows seven ultimate is worth the expense in this user's eye because he has hardware that can come remarkably close to being perfect for windows seven ultimate go microsoft for windows seven you made excellent choices in all but two areas of the windows seven experience windows eight however is as tough a sale as vista was but fora different reason because i do not want my desktop os even on a netbook to be the same as my mobile os and lion faces similar roadblocks from snow leopard update 1-17- two thousand and thirteen i will be updating all of the reviews for all of the windows seven installers i have on tap to reflect a certain difference betweem me and the average reviewer i to date have done all of my installs whether of ultimate full purchase product ultimate upgrade professional upgrade through the windows seven student offer home premium upgrade or home premium upgrade family pack through the clean install method and it never fails to grab all of the updates update to sp1 and then grab the missing post-sp one updates i therefore believe that the people who cannot fully update windows did not do the clean install method and while i do not blame them i do not have the time personally for a system that behaves strangely because windows vista was trying to be transmuted into windows seven when it is hard enough for one service pack of windows seven to be successfully transmuted into another i hope that if you are blaming windows seven for your issues when upgrading from vista that this advice can be of use update 11-21- two thousand and thirteen i since set it up with a third computer in a dell optiplex seven hundred and forty-five so i could experience what it is like on a real pc where it dual boots with xp professional from dell oem installer media asidefrom requiring a custom sound driver for the sound card to support the internal speaker that it has spent all the money on windows seven so now i cannot afford speakers that work it worked perfectly out of the box unfortunately after windows eight hit general availability windows eight gets media center that supports internet tv while that feature was removed from windows seven at microsoft's behest to push eight after finding windows eight does not like to dual-boot with windows seven on hardware that supports uefi i have one of the rare windows seven pcs to support uefi bought a month before windows eight general availability i am now looking at having to sit there and remove my windows seven hard disk to install eight and then manually put the windows seven hard disk back in and pray windows eight has not overwritten my default bios settings that are compatible i want media center to work on windows seven since this is a three hundred and twenty fully legal piece of software when used on computers it was officially activated with on windows seven home premium i really do not care but on windows seven ultimate i want media center and would gladly give up on internet explorer eleven and support of consumer versions to two thousand and twenty windows nine had better be better than eight and as good as seven if not i will buy a used macbook or pro with lion to replace the macbook pro whose fan overstressed so bad that i had to trade it at a loss applecare would not support it if it was not fully up-to-date and i did not want to update to lion that soon given the problem-prone nvidia graphics my older model macbook pro had the seven hundred and forty-five and a pc laptop i bought an upgrade copy of windows seven ultimate for that originally ran home premium vista both work so well but i insist on media center getting full support because with the bad things i have heard on windows eight and even suprisingly bad things for windows 8.1 i want to use windows seven ultimate long after it is internet browsing ability except to activate is gone that is just a rant from someone far too satisfied with windows seven for their own good or so the windows eight fanboys would say i consider myself a windows eight hater because microsoft did not make the right moves as regards windows eight end update 11-21- two thousand and thirteen update 2-3- two thousand and fourteen windows seven is a good os for those people who do not want a mac but do not want windows eight either it does do classic appearance differently from windows vista and earlier instead using the square buttons even in classic appearance but that is ok because i dreamed of an os with this functionality in the taskbar since windows ninety-five and the redesigned taskbar is even in windows seven home premium sure you may lose some of the features in the ultimate edition but you get everything you absolutely have to have-although windows seven anytime upgrade is no longer available to windows seven users so buying the right edition of windows seven is extra-crucial if you buy windows seven home premium and later find out you need xp mode you are going to have to sell your copy of home premium assuming you are using the retail copy and replace it with a retail copy of ultimate or professional windows xp may have been great in two thousand and one but windows seven is as close to xp as you can make vista-and has proven worthwhile ever since two thousand and nine for further proof look at how microsoft released internet explorer ten and eleven for windows seven they sure did not have to do that but they realized windows seven was still popular so popular i have seven copies of it including a family pack of home premium and so they released as many of their updated components as they could for windows seven without totally making windows 8/ 8.1 a non-issue end update 2-3- two thousand and fourteen update 2-27- two thousand and fourteen i was busy trying to do research to determine whether i should run windows eight on a late production windows seven pc or whether it would be a more productive use of the second hard drive in this pc to backup the system configuration and image of this copy of windows seven as well as my copy of windows seven professional upgrade and windows seven ultimate upgrade that had sp1 included well i sat there and started the backup to this other pc which had received a clean install of windows seven home premium family pack upgrade and office two thousand and three student and teacher edition and it was so easy i knew my money spent on high-end copies of windows seven rather than buying a windows home server which that os later was discontinued was oh so worth it a similar update will be on windows seven ultimate upgrade and windows seven professional upgrade end update 2-27- two thousand and fourteen update 9-16- two thousand and fourteen critical windows nine status update ): when that imac that had the full install copy bit the bullet the superdrive ruined the boot camp installer it is too old to use a thumb drive to load boot camp drivers let alone windows seven i had to find some other way to use windows seven ultimate thankfully by setting aside a spare cd-key of windows seven home premium that and the pc it went on was originally designed to allow the imac to backup before the imac's unreliability in windows seven ultimate torpedoed that option specifically an rtm product install rather than sp1 i was able to finally transfer windows seven ultimate from the imac to the formerly spare pc now i have got windows seven ultimate up and running with office two thousand and seven and do not miss a single thing why did i do this well consider what i uncovered about the supposedly awesome windows nine that is supposed to replace seven i also heard that windows nine may look like windows seven but this mini-start menu based on a microsoft press photo has live tiles where links to local computer items once stood in seven plus aero is still out for lunch defenders say skeumorphism is dead i say long live skeumorphism and microsoft ties your activation to the windows store so that means that they have a much more swift and sure means of sending your computer into reduced functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key i want my computer being rendered illegal for a good reason at least not for something trivial like windows nine allows for not because i did not buy enough apps from the windows store in a given day week month or year how are you supposed to use the metro-limited windows nine when not using metro apps early and often could be grounds for your computer to be rendered illegal according to microsoft in effect they have made metro mandatory and inaccessible rather than optional from the ability to legally use windows point of view not from the it is in your face while you are using it point of view and far too readily accessible i would rather have a minor bug as critical as the bug in question may be to the use of the computer in the form of bad ui than a horrible show-stopping bug that makes windows eight s ui crimes awful as they might have been seem minor i love that they are bringing back the start button but what they really needed to do was scrap the windows store and modern apps not make your computer depend on them but be unable to use them because it is a desktop known as win thirty-two sku i am sticking with windows seven and as soon as it is toast no more internet for me i would suggest you do the same end update 9-16- two thousand and fourteen critical windows nine status update,2.0,1.0,NN FW VBP CD JJ NNS IN NN CC NN NNS CD DT JJ CD NN NN DT DT JJ CD : NN NN FW PRP DT VBP

and glass case one a non-unibody twenty-four inch imac another a unibody 13.3 - inch macbook pro they both have core two duo processor and so would not run mac os x 10.7 to a decent level of capability then i hear how apple be go to deprecate the mobileme that i willingly pay one hundred and eighty for so it could stay around for two year now apple be go to throw not just that pittance but the money i spend on three intel mac and a time capsule that do what i want to over three thousand out the window so i strike back and keep snow leopard configure in a please manner i be smart about what i do on the internet and like the level of functionality i currently have and decide to supplement my snow leopard with window seven what version of window seven deserve to go on a intel mac for I the answer be simple the same version as what i have in snow leopard-not a single miss feature but not install with objectionable update which i do not want the mac app store and i do not want a window app store either so i run window seven ultimate on my two intel mac with the internet explorer nine and window seven sp1 hide and they will stay so as long as absolutely possible with that say here be my opinion of the various feature one the new taskbar it kick butt i have to download the window seven rc over a 1.5 mbit dsl connection just to experience the new taskbar early and when i get opportunity i buy window seven that so fat have be fully legal to avoid hassle and yes i know window seven have window genuine advantage but if that be go to be a issue i expect that microsoft will inform I of what to do about it the one problem i have be successfully deal with and they answer another question most kindly my experience have be top notch probably because god give I better luck i actually pray about thing like this and so far god have not fail I two homegroup when all three window seven computer be on and awake homegroup work perfectly for I i be most pleased with its performance three window xp mode all three computer have a edition of window seven that allow it although one do not support virtualization and the unassisted virtualization updater refuse to believe it be need i use it for microsoft sam and will not be afraid to load application into window xp mode should i need they the 13.3 - inch core two duo macbook pro have more audio garbling than the imac do the imac have almost none three bitlocker drive encryption i find one nice fellow who post direction on a way to make bitlocker work without a tpm 1.2 or better chip and it allow I to have access to every feature i pay for i be most pleased with window seven in that regard four language pack it help have a laptop and desktop that if i need to can switch language so i can help people who may need it i have not need it so far five the geek factor i must say window seven ultimate give I great pride that i can have access to not just the basic set of feature in home premium but that if someone have a problem with window seven professional enterprise or ultimate i can help they the feature that be also in window seven professional which i have on a old intel cantrino santa rosa mobile technology former vista laptop that be buy well before the offer to get a free window seven upgrade but that i use my student thirty offer for-i pay more to get extend download time and a dvd backup plus i get the thirty-two bit version which do not have the installation nightmare of the sixty-four bit version be also so good to have in the toolbox of available window seven feature i love out of the window seven professional level feature network aware printing i go to my aunt and uncle 's ginormous house every now and then and my window seven professional laptop and to be fair my window seven ultimate macbook pro now too can simply go from the color and black and white laser printer here to my aunt anduncle 's officejer j4580 and back again window seven hoem premium be too little for my dual-cre window seven computer although i will put it on my emachine-a w3622 with a single core celeron four hundred and twenty at 1.6 ghz and intel gma nine hundred and fifty barely aero-capable graphic plus i can have people who be have window seven issue send to I for remote assistance and pull they computer up on my imac which have a big enough screen to help most people especially if they have laptop and i can if the problem be not fixable under remote assistance take my macbook pro and have a point of comparison on-site with I especially since i get window seven from good to great discount through ebay for window seven ultimate and microsoft 's student offer for windo seven professional i feel like i get everything i need for plenty fair enough price i love the way three or more window seven computer work with each other i truly do love it i guess i better end this review before i take a eternity plus i see a commercial on tv that run a fair amount last year showie a computer at one person 's home be access by a laptop that someone let they borrow the remote computer be display a aero desktop on the laptop window vista even ultimate to the best of my knowledge could not do this so i investigate and after month of not know i find out that window seven ultimate with the experience section max could do it but professional could not if you love the aero eye candy and especially love window seven s improvement to it from vista that every bit as much as bitlocker and bitlocker to go or the language pack provide free make window seven ultimate worth the money over even professional provide you hardware can give you something at least approach a optimal experience in other word a bloomfield lynnfield clarksdale or arrandale or they sandy bridge successor for those who like they cpus or a core two duo quad or extreme with dedicated or nvidia integrate graphic will be just about perfect for window seven ultimate and if it can have 5ghz 802.11 n wifus and bluetooth 2.1 + edr or better along with gigabit ethernet and maybe a tpm 1.2 or better chip as well then that be all the better but anyway especially with worthy hardware window seven ultimate be worth the expense in this user 's eye because he have hardware that can come remarkably close to be perfect for window seven ultimate go microsoft for window seven you make excellent choice in all but two area of the window seven experience window eight however be as tough a sale as vista be but fora different reason because i do not want my desktop os even on a netbook to be the same as my mobile os and lion face similar roadblock from snow leopard update 1-17 - two thousand and thirteen i will be update all of the review for all of the window seven installer i have on tap to reflect a certain difference betweem I and the average reviewer i to date have do all of my install whether of ultimate full purchase product ultimate upgrade professional upgrade through the window seven student offer home premium upgrade or home premium upgrade family pack through the clean install method and it never fail to grab all of the update update to sp1 and then grab the miss post-sp one update i therefore believe that the people who can not fully update window do not do the clean install method and while i do not blame they i do not have the time personally for a system that behave strangely because window vista be try to be transmute into window seven when it be hard enough for one service pack of window seven to be successfully transmute into another i hope that if you be blame window seven for you issue when upgrade from vista that this advice can be of use update 11-21 - two thousand and thirteen i since set it up with a third computer in a dell optiplex seven hundred and forty-five so i could experience what it be like on a real pc where it dual boot with xp professional from dell oem installer media asidefrom require a custom sound driver for the sound card to support the internal speaker that it have spend all the money on window seven so now i can not afford speaker that work it work perfectly out of the box unfortunately after window eight hit general availability window eight get media center that support internet tv while that feature be remove from window seven at microsoft 's behest to push eight after find window eight do not like to dual-boot with window seven on hardware that support uefi i have one of the rare window seven pc to support uefi buy a month before window eight general availability i be now look at have to sit there and remove my window seven hard disk to install eight and then manually put the window seven hard disk back in and pray window eight have not overwritten my default bio setting that be compatible i want media center to work on window seven since this be a three hundred and twenty fully legal piece of software when use on computer it be officially activate with on window seven home premium i really do not care but on window seven ultimate i want media center and would gladly give up on internet explorer eleven and support of consumer version to two thousand and twenty window nine have better be better than eight and as good as seven if not i will buy a use macbook or pro with lion to replace the macbook pro whose fan overstress so bad that i have to trade it at a loss applecare would not support it if it be not fully up-to-date and i do not want to update to lion that soon give the problem-prone nvidia graphic my older model macbook pro have the seven hundred and forty-five and a pc laptop i buy a upgrade copy of window seven ultimate for that originally run home premium vista both work so well but i insist on media center get full support because with the bad thing i have hear on window eight and even suprisingly bad thing for window 8.1 i want to use window seven ultimate long after it be internet browse ability except to activate be go that be just a rant from someone far too satisfied with window seven for they own good or so the window eight fanboy would say i consider myself a window eight hater because microsoft do not make the right move as regard window eight end update 11-21 - two thousand and thirteen update 2-3 - two thousand and fourteen window seven be a good os for those people who do not want a mac but do not want window eight either it do do classic appearance differently from window vista and earlier instead use the square button even in classic appearance but that be ok because i dream of a os with this functionality in the taskbar since window ninety-five and the redesign taskbar be even in window seven home premium sure you may lose some of the feature in the ultimate edition but you get everything you absolutely have to have-although window seven anytime upgrade be no longer available to window seven user so buy the right edition of window seven be extra-crucial if you buy window seven home premium and later find out you need xp mode you be go to have to sell you copy of home premium assume you be use the retail copy and replace it with a retail copy of ultimate or professional window xp may have be great in two thousand and one but window seven be as close to xp as you can make vista-and have prove worthwhile ever since two thousand and nine for further proof look at how microsoft release internet explorer ten and eleven for window seven they sure do not have to do that but they realize window seven be still popular so popular i have seven copy of it include a family pack of home premium and so they release as many of they update component as they could for window seven without totally make window 8 / 8.1 a non-issue end update 2-3 - two thousand and fourteen update 2-27 - two thousand and fourteen i be busy try to do research to determine whether i should run window eight on a late production window seven pc or whether it would be a more productive use of the second hard drive in this pc to backup the system configuration and image of this copy of window seven as well as my copy of window seven professional upgrade and window seven ultimate upgrade that have sp1 include well i sit there and start the backup to this other pc which have receive a clean install of window seven home premium family pack upgrade and office two thousand and three student and teacher edition and it be so easy i know my money spend on high-end copy of window seven rather than buy a window home server which that o later be discontinue be oh so worth it a similar update will be on window seven ultimate upgrade and window seven professional upgrade end update 2-27 - two thousand and fourteen update 9-16 - two thousand and fourteen critical window nine status update -rrb- : when that imac that have the full install copy bit the bullet the superdrive ruin the boot camp installer it be too old to use a thumb drive to load boot camp driver let alone window seven i have to find some other way to use window seven ultimate thankfully by set aside a spare cd-key of window seven home premium that and the pc it go on be originally design to allow the imac to backup before the imac 's unreliability in window seven ultimate torpedo that option specifically a rtm product install rather than sp1 i be able to finally transfer window seven ultimate from the imac to the formerly spare pc now i have get window seven ultimate up and run with office two thousand and seven and do not miss a single thing why do i do this well consider what i uncovered about the supposedly awesome window nine that be suppose to replace seven i also hear that window nine may look like window seven but this mini-start menu base on a microsoft press photo have live tile where link to local computer item once stand in seven plus aero be still out for lunch defender say skeumorphism be dead i say long live skeumorphism and microsoft tie you activation to the window store so that mean that they have a much more swift and sure means of send you computer into reduce functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key i want my computer be render illegal for a good reason at least not for something trivial like window nine allow for not because i do not buy enough app from the window store in a give day week month or year how be you suppose to use the metro-limited window nine when not use metro app early and often could be grounds for you computer to be render illegal accord to microsoft in effect they have make metro mandatory and inaccessible rather than optional from the ability to legally use window point of view not from the it be in you face while you be use it point of view and far too readily accessible i would rather have a minor bug as critical as the bug in question may be to the use of the computer in the form of bad ui than a horrible show-stopping bug that make window eight s ui crime awful as they might have be seem minor i love that they be bring back the start button but what they really need to do be scrap the window store and modern app not make you computer depend on they but be unable to use they because it be a desktop know as win thirty-two sku i be stick with window seven and as soon as it be toast no more internet for I i would suggest you do the same end update 9-16 - two thousand and fourteen critical window nine status update,2865

488,i guess i have to be the voice of dissent among these positive reviews i have listened to this recording several times now and do not like it nearly as much as samantha's previous release identity she is going way too far down the smooth jazz road with results that are not pleasant the title track opens with this trend a boring and predictable tune that has little to offer the second track poquita has a nice guitar intro but this leads into the most vapid dancey drum machine-driven junk i have heard in some time please no more of this what follows is an assortment of unoriginal tunes until we get to clouds the stand-out song on the cd this and six of the clock are the best songs on the album samantha is at her best singing more traditional cabaret-style songs and clouds is easily one of her best amazing chord progressions and beautiful melodies interlude is lovely as well though far too short wild is also enjoyable with its unusual rhythmic patterns.finally we have tada yet another remix this is of the title track and all it has is more prominent fake drums plus throughout the album samantha has the occasional annoying tendency to sing slightly sharp this is a problem that has plagued all of her recordings and i suspect it has to do with headphone distortion i have experienced this myself many times in the studio it can be remedied by keeping one headphone off so that the ear hears the voice naturally.so basically sam here is some unsolicited advice lose the drum machine please ditch the less-than-inspiring instrumentals unless like interlude you really have something to say and please no more remixes move more toward the excellent cabaret style you have developed in songs like clouds and like a child and watch your tuning,0.0,0.0,LS NN FW VBP TO VB DT NN IN NN IN DT JJ NNS FW VBP VBN TO DT VBG JJ NNS RB CC VB RB IN PRP RB RB JJ IN NN POS JJ NN NN PRP VBZ VBG RB RB RB IN DT JJ NN NN IN NNS WDT VBP RB JJ DT NN NN VBZ IN DT NN DT NN CC JJ NN WDT VBZ JJ TO VB DT JJ NN NN VBZ DT JJ NN NN CC DT VBZ IN DT RBS JJ JJ VB JJ NN FW VBP VBN IN DT NN VB DT JJR IN DT WDT VBZ VBZ DT NN IN JJ NNS IN PRP VBP TO NNS DT JJ NN IN DT NN DT CC CD IN DT NN VBP DT JJS NNS IN DT NN NN VBZ IN PRP$ JJS NN RBR JJ JJ NNS CC NNS VBZ RB CD IN PRP$ JJS JJ NN NNS CC JJ NNS NN VBZ JJ RB RB IN RB RB JJ JJ VBZ RB JJ IN PRP$ JJ JJ RB PRP VBP NN RB DT NN DT VBZ IN DT NN NN CC DT PRP VBZ VBZ RBR JJ JJ NNS CC IN DT NN NN VBZ DT JJ JJ NN TO VB RB JJ DT VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ VBN DT IN PRP$ NNS CC FW VB PRP VBZ TO VB IN NN NN FW VBP VBN DT PRP JJ NNS IN DT NN PRP MD VB VBN IN VBG CD NN RB RB IN DT NN VBZ DT NN JJ RB NN RB VBZ DT JJ NN VBP DT VB NN VB NN DT JJ NNS IN IN NN PRP RB VBP NN TO VB CC VB DT JJR NNS VBP RBR IN DT JJ NN NN PRP VBP VBN IN NNS IN NNS CC IN DT NN CC VB PRP$ NN,i guess i have to be the voice of dissent among these positive review i have listen to this record several time now and do not like it nearly as much as samantha 's previous release identity she be go way too far down the smooth jazz road with result that be not pleasant the title track open with this trend a boring and predictable tune that have little to offer the second track poquita have a nice guitar intro but this lead into the most vapid dancey drum machine-driven junk i have hear in some time please no more of this what follow be a assortment of unoriginal tune until we get to cloud the stand-out song on the cd this and six of the clock be the best song on the album samantha be at she best singing more traditional cabaret-style song and cloud be easily one of she best amazing chord progression and beautiful melody interlude be lovely as well though far too short wild be also enjoyable with its unusual rhythmic patterns.finally we have tada yet another remix this be of the title track and all it have be more prominent fake drum plus throughout the album samantha have the occasional annoying tendency to sing slightly sharp this be a problem that have plague all of she recording and i suspect it have to do with headphone distortion i have experience this myself many time in the studio it can be remedy by keep one headphone off so that the ear hear the voice naturally.so basically sam here be some unsolicited advice lose the drum machine please ditch the less-than-inspiring instrumental unless like interlude you really have something to say and please no more remix move more toward the excellent cabaret style you have develop in song like cloud and like a child and watch you tuning,310

494,just got this today from a big box store in portland i have only been using it for four hours i was going to buy from amazon but for some reason the projected delivery time was three weeks from now that was too long for my purposes i did not want to go apple i wanted at least sixteen gb this is 14.1 gb formatted which is not surprising pros it is teeny tiny it may be smaller than some apple ipod nanos minimal controls but the menus seem to be well thought out you attach it and it is just a drive no itunes crapola to deal with i drag and drop mp3 folders with band album titles and pre-named numbered mp3 file and i am good to go i have microsoft windows seven pro computer operating system i get good sound with my sony mdr three hundred headphones cost 22.50 twenty-four ohms impedance one khzsensitivity db one hundred and two db mw is capable of putting out more volume that i can stand cons file copy is fairly slow but once you do inital setup and copy that is not so bad while it will drive my larger 63ohm sony studio cans headphones it does not produce a good sound with them bass on the larger headphones is weak unsatisfying so i am not using those headphones with this was hoping to do so for plane flight travel the eq is fairly limited five band does not have a lot of precision or major change effect yes it does something it is just kind of minimal the instructions for how to actually fully shut this mp3 player down powered off are a bit cryptic they say it goes into standby it may be that it never shuts off in the normal pull the plug no power sense it is do able you put it on pause and then hold down option button for awhile i guess a better way of saying this is the manual is minimal ___ other info charges by usb to mini-usb male connector two hours for full charge built in non-user replaceable battery overall you get a compact system i will report back later on how long a charge lasts and durability note you can supposedly play back pictures and movies with this it does display the mp3 album graphics fairly clearly i did not buy it for video still display cannot speak to that i have put many albums of mp3s on here and still have 4gb of space remaining if you can swing it buy at least a device with at least 16gb pre-formatted storage that gives you enough to cover a lot of moods genres of music without being forced to delete this to make room for that currently listening to moody blues in search of the lost chord it sounds good satisfying i give this a solid four stars at this time of initial impression ___ update 7/22 two thousand and sixteen i eventually moved onto a fiio x3 ii with a sandisk 128gb sdxc micro-flash card that is 2.7 x the cost of this sony unit but for me it was a must do reason i had

512,this review is going to be much like my review of the two thousand and nine edition of norton three hundred and sixty because except for the removal of the backup features the two programs are quite alike for the same reason i am not going to be so nice to symantec the makers of norton three hundred and sixty and norton internet security this time around i want to be clear that i am only referring to the windows xp version in this review i may post another one for windows seven users once my new system arrives.the main problem is this you absolutely cannot trust the firewall to work correctly on your system as configured as it is too permissive this means you run the risk of losing valuable personal information and or damaging your computer in the default set it and forget it mode it has continued to fail in almost every firewall test i have thrown at it as it does a horrible job of detecting and blocking potential threats on its own even a free firewall program provided by comodo performs better than norton internet security.the only way to make the firewall safe is to do the following steps one open the norton internet security homepage by doubleclicking on the icon in the system tray two in the box named network click on settings three scroll down to smart firewall click configure next to advanced settings four turn automatic program control off and advanced events monitoring on5 you will get a warning that it is for advanced users congratulations that is what you will become soon six hit apply to accept if your settings are correct it should match the image i uploaded to amazon.from this point forward it will start to ask you before you start a program or access the internet much like the previously referenced comodo firewall it will seem annoying at first however the interruptions will become less frequent as it learns the programs that you have designated as safe you may not recognize each individual file but you can make educated guesses for instance if the file is located in the directory of the program you just started up it is a high probability the file is legitimate because norton has started including file directories in its popup alerts it becomes much easier to locate files you are unsure of from there you can check the properties of the file to make sure they match the program's vendor microsoft or otherwise it just depends on how accepting you want to be after a while the interruptions will become infrequent unless you install something new or more importantly something uninvited is trying to access the internet without your permission it is not a foolproof method by any means but it is much safer than the norton three hundred and sixty and is two thousand and ten default which seems to be to allow anything you run to access the internet and or your computer as long as you perform these steps the firewall performs quite well.fortunately i can say that the antivirus works much better it even identified and quarantined a few of my firewall leaktests before i was able to run them no virus protector is one hundred safe however so the best way to protect your computer is still to practice safe surfing when i deliberately tried to run some questionable files one of them managed to make my computer unbootable and norton never stopped it the same thing happened to norton three hundred and sixty this brings me to another issue i sent that file to symantec months ago with specific details about what it does yet even now norton does not catch it i am starting to wonder how much they are paying attention to the files we send them maybe they are being overrun by the number of people submitting iexplore.exe as a potential virus.the database is still a mess of unnecessary messages that are service related rather than virus related there does seem to be some realization of this so this years version is a little less confusing with links to the database regarding particular issues youmay click on cosmetically norton has changed to yellow over black instead of black over yellow there is a nice buried feature called optimize to get there you need to flip the main menu to the performance history and click a tiny link of the same name not sure why it is tucked away but for this aging system i did notice some improvement in startup times symantec will honor the remaining days of a subscription to a former product and add them to this year's product but you will have to contact them it will also transfer your settings and identity cards and passwords however it will not use your identity card information on new websites per support you need to delete them in spite of the import and start over i also find it takes much longer to login than it did using norton three hundred and sixty almost a 10-15 second wait not sure if that was due to the import or a problem with the program.norton internet security two thousand and ten says on the box that it supports pop three and smtp now for its email scanner that would cover almost every email scanner on the market in symantec's world however that only means outlook and outlook express according to a support guy named kumar he says that in spite of the many popular email programs on the market norton continues to support only outlook and outlook express but he could not really explain why symantec appears to be flat out lying maybe he was stoned i will ask harold next time.one new feature that does not impress me are the constant popups saying i am the first person to run this program or that quite odd considering i get these warnings even after downloading a file from the symantec website you can remove this annoyance by clicking web settings then turning off download insight you have to turn it off completely otherwise it will simply delete any file it considers a risk one of these days symantec will realize we do not like it when they do that.in short this version of norton is not much of an improvement over last year's version and there were a ton of areas where they could have made improvements.lack instead of black over yellow there is a nice buried feature called optimize to get there you need to

much in the us it is very catchy most likely you will wake up singing it every other day the lyrics and instruments leave something to be desired but hey it is pop at it is best 5/53 rev it up this song is about a car ride it is actually a lot better than it sounds trust me this is an ok song they could definately have done better though 4/54 to you i belong another single it is a ballad and it is kind of sappy but entertaining at the same time it is got some great harmonies and you can hear the irish influence in the background music 5/55 rollercoaster this is as sugar filled as the album gets lyrics like today's the day we are out to play make this a cheesy classic it was another single from the album it is upbeat and cheery and undeneiably catchy but it lacks substance and maturity 4/56 blame it on the weatherman ummm . . . this is very weird and is one of those tracks where you have to listen to it several times before you start to like it it was their fourth single and a huge hit in europe 3.5 fifty-seven we four girls ok girls this is b witched not korn this song would be awesome recorded by another group but with four twentysomething irish girls with really high voices it sounds kind of strange 2/58 castles in the air this is one of their better slow songs good vocals a pleasant tune definately listenable this might appeal to older listeners more than younger though 5/59 freak out wahoo this is a great danceable track i really love the intro and the voices are just great once again horrible lyrics platorm shoes too high for hip-hop but that just adds to the fun 5/510 like the rose this is b witched being really mature this is a beautiful ballad that can bring tears to anybodies eyes actually i have no clue what it is about but it is still got a beautiful melody and is a nice slow song it is my favorite on the album five five hundred and eleven never giving up this is my second favorite track on the album it is upbeat and sugary without being too

power of the brilliant rust never sleeps am i showing my age here this album is also a reminder of what a great band crazy horse are the sound is terrific there is some great guitar work and they are tight and gutsy so even born in ontario the only slightly weak song on the album still sounds really good.neil young is often meditating on experience and aging here but he still sounds young and fresh and still has more power and guts than a lot of artists half his age several of the tracks are very long driftin back lasts nearly half an hour and other tracks are over fifteen minutes this of course is typical neil young refusing to bow to convention and doing whatever makes musical sense to him at the time he has always done this and it can be dreadful it sometimes has been in the past but nearly all the time here it is great the huge ramada inn is a masterpiece in my view and more conventional shorter tracks like twisted road may well end up in the list of neil young classics.there is little self-indulgence and a huge amount of real musical substance driftin back could perhaps do with a little trimming but it is still a really good track the last half of walk like a giant will probably get the skip-to-next treatment from me but its first eight minutes or so are quite brilliant.you have to hand it to the man he does not mess about and within six months of releasing the mediocre americana he has come up with a real cracker which i think will stand among his finest albums if you are not already familiar with neil young this may not be the best place to start but if you are i suspect that like me you will love this very very warmly recommended t mess about and within six months of releasing the mediocre americana he has come up with a real cracker which i think

741,well i like small portable flashes i have gone through a few sunpak one hundred and twenty-one s they are really cheap so i do not mind and contemplated a leica sf or contax tla two hundred flash which both use awkward batteries eventually this fuji flash came out promising to be compact with good build quality and manual controls i found one slightly used on ebay i have a x100 though my primary camera is a mamiya seven medium format film camera.pros awesome build quality seems to match the x-pro one and certainly does fine on my x100 takes aaas ... not quite as convenient as aas but still a lot better than those crazy batteries that other similar flashes take ttl metering on the fuji cameras is quite good though i use it mostly on manual controlling the flash is a breeze for this i would give it five stars really excellent and easy to switch between manual and ttl it works really conveniently as an off-camera flash triggered by your camera's built-in flash i love this feature my old nikon dslr had it and i cannot wait to use it more with the fuji although i suppose with a hotshoe extension cord you could retain ttl like the nikon somehow had comes with a leather case and a little tripod adapter as it should for over two hundred both nicely made it locks into the fujis with a little button release ... very nice feature it seems to still mount on all other cameras though it will not lock into the hotshoe.cons like most of the x100 s controls the exposure dial on the ef-x twenty is very loose and prone to being moved accidentally it is a little bit too big for the x100 from the photos i have seen it looks pretty balanced on the x-pro one and it feels like nothing on my mamiya seven but on the x100 it is a little heavy compared to the camera the auto-startup and shutdown when you turn off the camera the flash turns off too okay cool but if the camera is on and the flash is off and you try to turn the flash on itwill start up for about a quarter of a second and then just go back off after six or seven times of this it will finally stay on if the flash is already on and then you turn on the camera the flash will go off i am not sure if my unit is defective but that is pretty annoying i discovered that if you turn them both on at the same time they work.overall this flash functions pretty well on the fuji cameras once you get it turned on i really wish this flash had an auto setting with a mini exposure chart on the back like the sunpaks do they can be used with any camera really easily i guess if you only shoot digital manual mode is a fine alternative i use it plenty on film too is it the perfect flash for any camera it is just okay for that it is really small and portable much stronger and higher up than the x100 s flash and would make a good addition to any kit i use flash a lot and this one is probably the best option for the x100 and x-pro one unless you need to be bouncing light,3.0,1.0,RB FW IN JJ JJ NNS FW VBP VBN IN DT

DT NN CC NN CD IN PRP VBP TO VB VBG NN,well i like small portable flash i have go through a few sunpak one hundred and twenty-one s they be really cheap so i do not mind and contemplate a leica sf or contax tla two hundred flash which both use awkward battery eventually this fuji flash come out promising to be compact with good build quality and manual control i find one slightly use on ebay i have a x100 though my primary camera be a mamiya seven medium format film camera.pros awesome build quality seem to match the x-pro one and certainly do fine on my x100 take aaa ... not quite as convenient as aa but still a lot better than those crazy battery that other similar flash take ttl metering on the fuji camera be quite good though i use it mostly on manual control the flash be a breeze for this i would give it five star really excellent and easy to switch between manual and ttl it work really conveniently as a off-camera flash trigger by you camera 's built-in flash i love this feature my old nikon dslr have it and i can not wait to use it more with the fuji although i suppose with a hotshoe extension cord you could retain ttl like the nikon somehow have come with a leather case and a little tripod adapter as it should for over two hundred both nicely make it lock into the fuji with a little button release ... very nice feature it seem to still mount on all other camera though it will not lock into the hotshoe.cons like most of the x100 be control the exposure dial on the ef-x twenty be very loose and prone to be move accidentally it be a little bit too big for the x100 from the photo i have see it look pretty balance on the x-pro one and it feel like nothing on my mamiya seven but on the x100 it be a little heavy compare to the camera the auto-startup and shutdown when you turn off the camera the flash turn off too okay cool but if the camera be on and the flash be off and you try to turn the flash on itwill start up for about a quarter of a second and then just go back off after six or seven time of this it will finally stay on if the flash be already on and then you turn on the camera the flash will go off i be not sure if my unit be defective but that be pretty annoying i discover that if you turn they both on at the same time they work.overall this flash function pretty well on the fuji camera once you get it turn on i really wish this flash have a auto setting with a mini exposure chart on the back like the sunpak do they can be use with any camera really easily i guess if you only shoot digital manual mode be a fine alternative i use it plenty on film too be it the perfect flash for any camera it be just okay for that it be really small and portable much stronger and higher up than the x100 be flash and would make a good addition to any kit i use flash a lot and this one be probably the best option for the x100 and x-pro one unless you need to be bounce light,575

768,i like puzzles that make sense and these did you push a button you see the result without having to hunt around for what is going on for example in mysterious journey two there is several puzzles where you have to form a circuit or connect one side of a grid to another by clicking on dials ... very straight-forward puzzles draw the grids out and it is not difficult to work out on paper in another you find your way across a fog enshrouded pathway very cool by plotting the path from below.while there is very little having to combine information from several sources to figure out a puzzle it does occur once or twice druing the main part of the game and again at the end and there is a few math-based puzzles too in varying degrees of difficulty hey that is what universal hint system is for still gamers with more experience than i might not have much problem wtih them.an earlier reviewer mentioned that half the time a puzzle led to nothing just an area to look out of i am not sure where the reviewer is referring to but i did not find that to be true you open a door and there is something to find learn about in a cut-scene see or do behind it.the storyline is interesting and well developed and the ending is satisfying.as far as graphics i am not a tech person but i found them to be very pretty i wish i could have roamed a bit more in a few places the graphics looked just too inviting to simply view from afar the landscape is filled with bright colors and intriguing designs this is not click and point so you are able to move about freely.the music is not great but at least it does not detract from the game the voices are fine a cut above most games the mechanical voices are done with a bit of special effects a nice touch the computer-rendered people move fairly naturally you have little control over settings but in my experience the game ran fine athlon 64x2 geforce 7600gs i wish there were more games like this puzzles clues that are scattered hither and yon

790,i am rather ashamed to admit that though i have always respected her obvious musical talent from afar i would somehow managed to escape fiona's charms all these years ... until the other night when i could not resist any longer after being intrigued enough by the samples i would heard here and on her myspace page i purchased the idler wheel ... that same night and proceeded to listen to it three times straight through the first time i was bewildered by what i was hearing as it was difficult for me to connect with in the same way it is difficult for me to connect with the avant-garde jazz of john coltrane or thelonious monk even though i could definitely appreciate the artistry involved in the music's construction the second time it all made a little more sense but i still was not totally feeling it toward the end of my third listen however i realized my cheeks were starting to hurt i would been smiling from ear to ear for about a good thirty minutes straight.this is an album that works so perfectly as a whole work of art it is hard for me to cite specific highlights most of the songs are dependent on the ebbs and flows of what came before to have its maximum effect so i definitely recommend listening to this album straight through a few times or at least in large chunks before deciding this is not your thing like some fans are saying as a fan of more guitar-driven rock it is not really my thing either or so i thought then i just put my headphones on let go of all my preconceived notions of what it should sound like and let fiona bring me into her world a world that to me is almost like some weird parallel-dimension 1940s in which she is the billie holiday of that reality only one who plays a mean piano with odd time-signatures curlicue melodies household object-based percussion and insanely varied vocals and lyrics that make you feel her wide spectrum of emotions even if you do not quite fully understand them.fiona can go from singing about love to anger to sorrow to despair to paranoia to neon zebras within the span of a couple songs and the result is intoxicating if you just give in to it and let her take you there her voice ranges from angelic to maniacal and everything in between sometimes all within the same song leaving me feeling almost exhausted at times but by the time i get to the excellent kaleidoscopic and insane hot knife which closes the album i am usually ready to take another ride the production on the album is very sparse with rarely more than piano and percussion framing fiona's voice but that only helps magnify the range and authenticity of emotion coming out of her and the result is as close to perfection as i am likely to hear this year or any year the idler wheel ... is not always an easy fun ride but i can almost guarantee that if you let it it will be a fulfilling one there is no higher compliment i can give than that it is not impenetrable some works of art are just deeper and take longer to sink in and those are the ones that tend to stick with you longer and affect you more profoundly this album will one day be considered a masterpiece i am sure but i am just thankful to have finally discovered her beautiful work even if i am about a decade and a half late hopefully she does not take another seven years to resurface next time though thankfully i will have a few new-to-me old albums of hers to tide me over in the meantime and i am sure that if her next album is anywhere near as brilliant and inspiring as this one the wait will definitely have been worth it the live dvd included with the deluxe version is very high-quality and well worth spending the extra cash for as fiona is in top form at least as far as i can tell considering i am a fiona apple newbie,3.0,1.0,FW

836,i installed premier two thousand and fifteen every thing seems to have worked fine the program backed up my earlier version files fine and converted fine amazon shows that quicken will update fine from two thousand and ten forward i updated from two thousand and nine and i do not see any problems but will have to look further but on first glance seems ok i decided to upgrade since i have not changed in a number of years product reviews sometimes reflect the experience or lack thereof of the user i am reasonably computer knowledgeable and am pleased with the program so far will update going forward if any problems pop up but starting out quicken premier has worked well i use turbotax every year everyone knows the problem this year with the change in deluxe luckily intuit did follow through with the free upgrade to premier where necessary in my opinion intuit could be a lot more user friendly going forward have spent some time putting in accounts and had some trouble with update five but backing up and reinstalling was effective and the update worked fine i see now that update six has caused problems and quicken took it off their servers until they can fix the update i think the program code could probably be better i would guess it is smart to hold off on patches when they are first released any new code can cause unexpected problems quicken is no different too much reworking and yearly updates to get may be a negative but overall the program is working for me it does not handle every transaction well i had difficulty putting in ee bonds there seems to be no simple way to set it up and have it track interest still i am reasonably satisfied but could always be better i know many are frustrated but it would seem to be difficult for any program to handle so many different transactions 5/11 fifteen update update quicken's update five which was installed with a popup dialogue box caused the program to lose some functionality i deleted the program under windows programs and features and then used quicken's clean ui to further clean the program from the computer i originally used just quicken's clean ui but that did not work by itself so the reinstall worked fine and i did not reinstall update five i will hold off on that now as the program seems to work ok changed to three stars because the update caused problems with the program update i installed the release patch five as requested by a popup the release patch has caused problems with functionality working on it so far no luck updates can cause problems,3.0,1.0,LS VBN JJR CD CD CC CD

and convert fine amazon show that quicken will update fine from two thousand and ten forward i update from two thousand and nine and i do not see any problem but will have to look further but on first glance seem ok i decide to upgrade since i have not change in a number of year product review sometimes reflect the experience or lack thereof of the user i be reasonably computer knowledgeable and be please with the program so far will update go forward if any problem pop up but start out quicken premier have work well i use turbotax every year everyone know the problem this year with the change in deluxe luckily intuit do follow through with the free upgrade to premier where necessary in my opinion intuit could be a lot more user friendly go forward have spend some time put in account and have some trouble with update five but back up and reinstall be effective and the update work fine i see now that update six have cause problem and quicken take it off they server until they can fix the update i think the program code could probably be better i would guess it be smart to hold off on patch when they be first release any new code can cause unexpected problem quicken be no different too much reworking and yearly update to get may be a negative but overall the program be work for I it do not handle every transaction well i have difficulty put in ee bond there seem to be no simple way to set it up and have it track interest still i be reasonably satisfied but could always be better i know many be frustrated but it would seem to be difficult for any program to handle so many different transaction 5/11 fifteen update update quicken 's update five which be install with a popup dialogue box cause the program to lose some functionality i delete the program under window program and feature and then use quicken 's clean ui to further clean the program from the computer i originally use just quicken 's clean ui but that do not work by itself so the reinstall work fine and i do not reinstall update five i will hold off on that now as the program seem to work ok change to three star because the update cause problem with the program update i install the release patch five as request by a popup the release patch have cause problem with functionality work on it so far no luck update can cause problem,456

theypointed me to my laptop manufacturer's website ... and told me that the support page there would have the latest bluetoothdrivers.this was not exactly correct there were no updates to the bluetooth drivers on this page but there was an update to the bluetoothmanagement application when i downloaded and installed that update the headset successfully paired and i have been using it withan ip phone application on my laptop so far so go the quality is acceptable and the range seems to be good i was evenable to pair it with a second device droid maxx although i have yet to use it with that device let alone answer calls or switchbetween devices using it with a second device was a bit tricky the document did not help much but i think the basic idea is to paireach device separately with the other bluetooth turned off turn everything off and then turn everything back on again and then wait.eventually both devices found the headset and connected i will update this review again after i use it some more beware win seven driver issues sent a link that wants more money to get the right driver the above rating is temporary until the issue i am having is resolved i just received the headset and tried to pair it with my win seven sixty-four bit laptop after the device was recognized by my bluetooth manager it told me that it need to find and update the drivers for the device so i let windows do that it came back and said that it could not update the driver and to contact the manufacturer so i did they responded within a day and sent me alink supposed pointing to the proper drivers in reality the link pointed to an application called drivertuner which scans the laptop and find all the out-of-date drivers i keep my drivers up to date religiously so this got me suspicious so i selected just the bt driver for the headset and told it to download that it still attempted to download all the out-of-date drivers worse in order to finish the job it told me i had to register this copy of drivertuner which by the way is installed itself as a auto-starting system tray app even though i explicitly unchecked the box telling it to do that during installation even worse still in order to register took me to a webpage asking thirty for the license key at that point i had enough exited the webpage and the app which i had to do twice because it minimized itself to the tray and attempted to uninstall the app even that did not go smoothly i had to hunt down and manually delete all the leftovers the uninstaller could not remove needless to say i ran my virus scanner afterwards i have sent a followup to taotronics asking them to simply send me the necessary driver and told them i did not wish to pay an additional thirty to get this headset

1093,i had a wonderful pair of sony earbuds before which were similar to these but unfortunately my cat chewed them completely apart ... those were the best i would owned and i wish i still had them or knew where to find them regardless i had to find a replacement and so invested in the most similar pair of earbuds i could find in the hook style but i tried philips those were god-awful and the left earbud burned out after a short while.so this was my next option once i found it from my past experience and my father's headphones which are sony incredibly ancient and working like a charm i figured i could not go wrong.the cord comes with an extender that is incredibly long i absolutely loved that unfortunately on a road trip no less i had a scare where these earbuds were dying on me too you know where you will need to turn the jack in your ipod in order for the sound to come through properly not good turns out the problem was the extender once i deatched that the earbuds worked fine and have been working fine ever since my issue is that the cord is now unusually short but i suppose that has its benefits and i have learned to live with it.now sound quality i have no idea how to judge earbuds on sound quality so i had to experiment until i found a kind that was decent these are excellent if you try earbuds like these you will never go back to the kind that comes with the ipod i will save you time and tell you now to not bother with earbuds that do not cushion inside your ear unless you absolutely cannot stand that feeling even then i suggest you learn to get used to it because it will change your listening experience for the better the noise cancellation is stellar as well which this style is famous for a little fyi my ipod nano at half the max volume is my standard volume during school it is loud enough that i cannot hear a thing around me but the music but quiet enough that no one else can hear a peep from my music even in complete silence.if you can stand it too do not bother with earbuds that do not have a hook i will never change back to any style other than in-ear hook earbuds unless i can someday afford high quality headphones for at-home listening these never fall out unless i really tug them and even then i would need to tug them sideways.if anything happens to these i am sure it will not be for a while and i will be sticking with sony in this style anyway.music even in complete silence.if you can stand it too do not bother with earbuds that do not have a hook i will never change back to any style other than in-ear hook earbuds unless i can

chew they completely apart ... those be the best i would own and i wish i still have they or know where to find they regardless i have to find a replacement and so invest in the most similar pair of earbud i could find in the hook style but i try philip those be god-awful and the left earbud burn out after a short while.so this be my next option once i find it from my past experience and my father 's headphone which be sony incredibly ancient and work like a charm i figure i could not go wrong.the cord come with a extender that be incredibly long i absolutely love that unfortunately on a road trip no less i have a scare where these earbud be die on I too you know where you will need to turn the jack in you ipod in order for the sound to come through properly not good turn out the problem be the extender once i deatched that the earbud work fine and have be work fine ever since my issue be that the cord be now unusually short but i suppose that have its benefit and i have learn to live with it.now sound quality i have no idea how to judge earbud on sound quality so i have to experiment until i find a kind that be decent these be excellent if you try earbud like these you will never go back to the kind that come with the ipod i will save you time and tell you now to not bother with earbud that do not cushion inside you ear unless you absolutely can not stand that feeling even then i suggest you learn to get use to it because it will change you listen experience for the better the noise cancellation be stellar as well which this style be famous for a little fyi my ipod nano at half the max volume be my standard volume during school it be loud enough that i can not hear a thing around I but the music but quiet enough that no one else can hear a peep from my music even in complete silence.if you can stand it too do not bother with earbud that do not have a hook i will never change back to any style other than in-ear hook earbud unless i can someday afford high quality headphone for at-home listen these never fall out unless i really tug they and even then i would need to tug they sideways.if anything happen to these i be sure it will not be for a while and i will be stick with sony in this style anyway.music even in complete silence.if you can stand it too do not bother with earbud that do not have a hook i will never change back to any style other

1121,i am not kidding when i say that i have been watching these headphones for a while they have been sitting on my wish list and just recently i decided that i could afford to treat myself a little gift i should not have i just got them today now before i continue to my review i would like to note that when i read other people's reviews i usually discard the opinions of those who have only had a product for a really short amount of time because people usually have not had the product long enough to find the issues that eventually turn up or adequately worked through confusions misunderstandings and hidden tricks i however feel quite strongly that if i do not write this review now while my experience is still fresh i will procrastinate and never get it done.before i open the package i can see that one of the silicone coverings is missing i placed my faith in humanity though and opened the box anyway hoping that it had merely fallen out of its designated slot as i did get them from an amazon warehouse deal nope nada gone fortunately they are not one of the sizes i prefer to wear but this did not leave a fantastic first impression with me i take out the earbuds and admire the look of them they look really nice and i was hoping to get some quality sound from them i was not expecting fantastic sound from them but i was hoping that they would be at least a margin better than decent especially with all of the positive reviews that i have been reading i put them in my ears without connection and i can immediately tell that they do not fit in well this was rather disappointing i have adjusted them multiple times and simply left them in my ears hoping that i would just get used to the feel but they fall out of my ears with even the slightest bump movement or pull i was sitting at the computer listening to youtube music and my left side just falls out so disappointing i even changed the coverings to the smallest sizeand i felt no difference.they are not well noise isolating headphones not unless you decide to blast the music to the point of eardrum damaging and sound leaking i am not an audiophile but i wore them during some sound tests on youtube and i really was not impressed by the quality of sound either maybe this is just because i am used to sony mdr-x five headphones which naturally emphasize the bass but i am not a bass fanatic i want good and clear mid and high tones too.to make matters worse my left side was starting to pop and crackle while i was watching some vlogbrother videos i plugged them in all the way i want my money back discounted price and all so far they are not any better than the cheap 5-10 earbuds that accompany mp3 players which i have worn their only saving grace is that during a 3d sound test they performed quite well it earned them some time for a second chance i am thinking that i will keep them around until tomorrow and see if things do not resolve themselves out i am not a person who easily considers

1190,every wwi flight sim fan has been eagerly awaiting the release of rise of flight earlier named knights of the sky and watching it is progress over the last several years it was expected to be the next great redbaron replacement but what we got instead is a very lean empty feeling simulator that is going to have to add a lot of content to catch up to rb or some other sims much has been covered in the previous comments and i agree with many of the comments good and bad but i will go ahead and add my own list of what immediately strikes me as good and bad or not available yet the best comment was that this is a wip work in progress so just be aware of what you are getting .. and be aware that there is no refund and no way to sell the game dvd down the road or the seven each add on aircraft if you decide you do not like it or get tired of it the on line requirement for single player or multi player is a copy protection system and unless they change things only one buyer is allowed .. so no resale on ebay etc unless they change their policy my general conclusion is that it is inconsistent in all areas so i will comment on the good and bad in each area that i can think of fantastic lighting effects and animated shadows in the cockpit and on objects along with beautiful reflections on water and other reflective surfaces the flight model fm appears to be the best of any flight sims done so far .. it just feels real and comments by fliers of ultra lights and other small planes generally agree it is the best yet the ai artificial inteligence computer pilots seem to be rather docil when fighting and not that well done or not very evasive when shot at .. too easy to shoot down .. the only thing that makes shooting them down hard is the plane you are flying that has this wonderful feeling of bouncing about with every little air currant makes it very hard to aim the cockpits are fully animated with working controls and full 3d .. they are amazing looking but i would like to see a pilot extensions of arms and legs working the stick and pedals as done in some other sims exterior shots show animated pilots and gunners and they add a lot to the feeling of live people in the planes instead of rigid mannequins as in most other sims however the pilots are too small scaled and have been proven to be too small in some forum discussions not a big deal and some still disagree but just one more thing that i feel needs attention dm damage model is excellent with all sorts of plane damage that looks convincing in almost all situations one of the best i have seen terrain is very impressive from high up but scenery objects and textures disappear to close in distance from the player lower down there are impressive looking trees and buildings etc but the colors of much of it look cartoonish with areas of unending prestine grass rivers way to prestine and clean too brightly colored .. the textures are to simplistic if you circle around a tree it rotates to always face you giveing a rather odd look to it over the trenches there is a wonderfull smokey look but the textures are even worse here with continuous non stop craters and at times obvious repeating texture patterns showing along with odd looking grey outlined trenches that look like zippers and other then the explosions going on everywhere there seems to be an empty feeling below that brings up the big problem of this sim it just feels empty like nothing is going on down below if you wander away from the scripted mission triggered event points you do not see anything going on unlike dynamic campaign wwi sims like redbaron or over flanders fields where there are historical events taking place all around you in real time clouds are really well done but very limited in type or looks there are excellent feelings of fog and rain but there are no seasonal terrains yet no snow no frost no spring terrain that is another thingthat will be added later as one of their add ons for free or sound effects are excellent they just seem real and are impressive there are some very well done training exercises with an animated eddie rickenbacker narrating in a very close to real sounding voice figure modeling is good but stilted and not on a par with even older games like mafia plane graphics are beautifully done with full details and many moving working 3d model parts like shutters etc the games interface is beautifully rendered with 3d hangers but very limited in scope and often confusing not well organized and often hard to use like the requirement to leave the game to make adjustments to game settings stick settings etc there is no musical score to add drama to the feeling of the era and very little historical content except for plane information much of the english is poorly translated from the russian which can look silly at times or be hard to decipher so is rise of flight the next great red baron replacement not by a long shot they are going to need to add a lot to get near to that description is it worth buying now absolutely if you want one incredible wwi plane flying experience but with only a few planes and a few plane skins each and very little else to go with it so far i hope people do buy this game and i hope they continue to improve it but it looks like it will be awhile before it feels fully rounded mean while there is over flanders fields which has not received the recognition it deserves and is not widly known about but those who have found it mostly agree it is indeed the currant replacement for red baron created by a group of former early red baron and rb3d mod makers and wwi historians it got undeserved bad forum comments because of it is reliance on the wwii combat flight simulator three game the early phase one and two problems and the requirement to buy it in phase three the payware version three between heaven and hell still relies on having a cfs three game disk available for install but is a vast improvement over the earlier off versions in almost every way the only thing used from cfs three now is the game engine the data base is completely off and seperate from cfs three and there is nothing left of cfs three that is recognizable it has very good flight model though not as good as rof but it is being improved for version four to come out soon and some are going to be surprised it does not have the lighting and reflections of rof but much better varied full seasons with historical weather and terrain textures that are more varied and believable in most cases it has a huge selection of planes to fly including two seaters and thousands of authentic historically researched plane skins a dynamic historical campaign covering the whole war means there is a full feeling of involvement in this simulator with life

1243,"i was looking for a replacement stereo system for my existing pioneer deh-p six thousand , five hundred which was manufactured in two thousand and two i was worried that the audio quality would be worse since that seems to be the way most other consumer electronics are headed.after powering on the stereo i immediately realized i had nothing to worry about this unit sounds even better than my old one.the clarity of high frequencies is about the same the midrange sound when compared to other units i have tested is still lacking a little bit but this unit thankfully has a bass booster adjuster which helps a little bit and speaking of bass this unit has really hard hitting bass on my two three hundred and fifty watt ten s and it sounds much deeper and more accurate than my old pioneer unit.the built in hd radio sounds crystal clear on my four way sony door and rear deck speakers also i had never actually heard hd radio before and i immediately noticed a difference when compared to a normal fm tuner so i am really pleased with that then again i am probably the only person who even listens to fm anymore.the bluetooth works seamlessly and has great sound quality and works every single time i use it since the very first time i connected it which itself only took about thirty seconds.the display is very good as well viewing angles are some of the best i have seen on an lcd screen and it even looks pretty good in direct sunlight.it s very easy to navigate through the menus in my opinion and thw buttons do not feel as cheap as some other units also the system never lags and there are no delays from pressing buttons or scrolling through the different menus and screens.as far as any negative aspects ... i really cannot think of any they would all be personal opinions anyway.so overall if you are looking for a replacement head unit that has excellent crystal clear sound a nice display and easy-to-navigate menus lool no further pioneer is still runningstrong and when this one eventually does die i plan on buying another pioneer i would recommend this stereo to anyone who is looking for the qualities i have listed above.hope this review helps

1416,"i am a perennial naysayer when it comes to quicken's upgrades yes i agree with everyone who complains about intuit's business model of introducing mandatory upgrades periodically that one is forced to take because older versions become obsoleted but ultimately time marches on and software does need to be upgraded once having accepted the inevitible intuit notified me they would no longer be supporting premier two thousand and seven come april two thousand and ten i sighed a deep sigh and purchased quicken two thousand and ten rental property version for all practical intents and purposes this is quicken premier two thousand and ten with a couple extra bells and whistles so my review is for both products.after installing quicken property manager two thousand and ten i checked every account and report that was critical to me apart from the usual cosmetic gui differences i found nothing amiss the migration of data files went very smoothly and for once there is an aspect of quicken's upgrades worth the hassle now instead of four or five separate quicken files intuit manages to keep everything in one albeit larger file in terms of keeping track of backup files this is a significant improvement.also all settings and functionality remained intact downloading transactions from several brokerage accounts continue to work flawlessly i do not download transactions from banks or credit card companies i tried this once for an existing credit card account and ended up with hundreds of unwanted transactions in the upload if starting with a new credit card or bank account i imagine it would be nice to simply upload the transactions from the financial institution doing so into an existing account proved more hassle than i wanted to deal with so i continue to hand enter the couple dozen credit card transactions a month i deal with having recently acquired a rental property i opted for this version over quicken premier two thousand and ten whether or not the additional functionality of keeping a data base of rental properties is useful to you may depend on how many you have i only have the one and i already set up the transactions in the earlier version i am not sure its even worth my while to investigate this functionality but if you have many investment properties this might be a better way of keeping track of properties tennants income flow mortgage payments and tax related transaction this is the only funtional difference i see between quicken rental property two thousand and ten and quicken premier two thousand and seven i have investment accounts some with transaction going back to one thousand , nine hundred and eighty-two e g a mutual fund that i have been dollar cost averaging into since then so for managing my investment portfolio quicken premier is minimally a necessity on that front my only beefs are that one a graph that used to be available many versions ago is still sadly missing they used to have the ability to chart stock price history and market value on the same graph quite useful to see at a glance how well or poorly you timed the market with your purchases or sales luckily i get close to this functionality in fidelity's active trader charting two investment performance reporting continues to be problematic under certain circumstances performance statistics are annualized so at the beginning of a calendar year you could be looking at some grossly exaggerated performance numbers the same holds true for positions you only held for a short period of time what seems to be missing is a simple report that gives you the actual percentage gain or loss on a specific trade for example let us say you bought one hundred shares of xyz corp at ten per share today and you sold it tomorrow for eleven this is a simple ten actual gain ignoring transaction costs in quicken this is annualized to some phenominally large percentage as if you had earned ten per day for the entire year when analysing individual security performance this can be problematic three exporting to excel has never been a strong suit you can indeed export an account to excel but you cannot subsequently update an existing excel spreadsheet this is a pain it would be nice to develop reports in excel that quicken simply does not provide if you go throught the effort of exporting data to a spreadsheet it would be nice if you did not have to start from scratch every time now if i am simply undereducated in the use of excel then please someone out there direct me to the appropriate feature that would allow me to append a new month's worth of data to an existing spreadsheet via quicken export.now for the biggest improvement in the quicken experience since my last upgrade quicken actually has telephone support staff that call you when you have install or program issues i thought i found a bug in the net worth reporting in two thousand and ten i followed the support links under help and opted to have a quicken tech support person call me on the phone within minutes a very knowledgable support rep called me back and spent about an hour helping me debug the problem this included having me upload quicken premier seven uninstalling quicken two thousand and ten reinstalling the two thousand and seven program to see if the bug predated the two thousand and ten upgrade to make a long story short the problem orininated last year and had nothing to do with quicken two thousand and ten or the upgrade to said program now ultimately i did need to find the single transaction that hosed the report myself i deleted the transaction and reentered it bingo problem solved today i reinstalled quicken rental property two thousand and ten and am getting on with my life still i cannot say enough how stunned i am merely to know that after all these years of non-existant customer support intuit has finally delivered all in all i would say you need not be afraid of upgrading to quicken two thousand and ten none of the horror story events reported elsewhere amazon's reviews of quicken two thousand and ten happened if you check my reviewer history you will see that i have been highly critical of intuit in the past this upgrade has enough in it for me to justify the upgrade.good luckaccount to excel but you cannot subsequently update an existing excel spreadsheet this is a pain it would be

1459,"first of all i got lucky on the price of this unit amazon warehouse deals had one for about sixty less than the usual retail price and the only flaw was a tiny ding in the plastic of the ipod dock that comes with the ar30 otherwise this is a completely new unit and functions flawlessly i bought the complete sonata component system ar30 dv30 cd30 and np30 to replace my fifteen year old jvc f3000 compact stereo system a gem of a mini-system which i finally had to retire due to the cd player and tape deck no longer performing reliably i have a relatively short wall and a small entertainment console where my stereo system sits so the small footprint of the sonata components is a necessity for me i love the brushed aluminum silver cases to me this is classier looking than the typical black that most component manufacturers stick with but that is just cosmetic and everyone's taste is different ca also made the sonata system in black made because the sonata components are no longer part of ca's current line in terms of performance i am very happy with the ease of use sound quality and functionality of the ar30 and the other sonata components from a cold start the ar30 is a tad slow -8.4 seconds from clicking the remote on to ready-to-play--but not enough to complain about with 40w per channel at eight ohms it is more than enough to drive my klipsch rb sixty-one ii speakers the volume control maxes out at a setting of thirty-nine and i have never had it over twenty-five so unless you like busting your eardrums you will be fine.each component in the sonata system comes with its own remote and they are all interoperable there are dedicated buttons at the base of the remote for selecting which component to control the dvd remote has the biggest array of buttons and is a little heavier than the receiver or cd remotes all the components have simple clear arrays of buttons on their front panels the receiver controls are basic--there's no graphic equalizer for example just bass treble and balance--but i have not found this to be a drawback since the sound quality is crystal pure the receiver has a separate in out for a subwoofer the input comes from the dvd player and works fine with my polk ps10.the sonata line has been discontinued by ca and has not been replaced by a similar small footprint model the sonata is only 270mm wide whereas the ca topaz and azur current lines are full-sized at 430mm wide so if you are in the market for a compact component system grab one of these now before current retail inventories disappear i bought three of the four components from amazon two new one barely used and i got the np30 used six mos old on ebay with careful shopping i paid just 1,008 for everything shipping included if money is no object in your pursuit of perfect audio then you can indulge in higher-end components than the sonata but if you are on a budget or if you need a second system for a rec room etc the sonata delivers terrific sound

places that will install a product like this most smaller establishments do not want to mess with something and be liable for something you did not buy from them buying this online is the best way to go but be forewarned first my particular product from sigmaenterprieses came intact but upon installation was discovered either the remotes or alarm module was non functioning this one troubleshooted by swapping the module with one from the shelf the installer noted that there should be a quality control white sticker that covers the opening of the box if yours does not we weary second if you have a newer car say circa two thousand and seven and on then be on the look out for added component costs i had to consider a flcan module that does not come included in this package and is set for a range of models of cars oh and btw all the name brand companies of alarms and modules are all produced by mainly one company directed electronics the module allows the alarm to talk with your car's computer that controls all functionality of door locks windows basically anything electronic third key chip the newer cars including this guy's two thousand and eleven subaru have encoded keys since the idea of auto start is to trick the car's computer into believing a key's in there its much more difficult with these types more than likely you will have to purchase a 556uw this module allows you to place a key in it and wrap it with some type of wire that is able to read the chip inside your key which in turn sends a signal to the flcan just the installation alone with these parts can cost you upwards of four hundred i am in the middle of having the non-functioning components replaced either through sigma or some other way and will post a further of the product when this mission is

1484,"do you need a basic but docx xlsx pptx capable version of real microsoft office openoffice not doing a good enough job for what you need are you put off by office two thousand and thirteen which does not offer three product keys for your trouble are you even more put off with microsoft turning office into software as a service with office three hundred and sixty-five well you are going to have to accept some compromises namely the hated ribbon and not having all the office apps but there are z number of people who have late windows xp early windows vista era pcs that are perfect for secondary production running windows seven from a retail upgrade disk-and when you do the clean install upgrade for windows which you will eventually have to do due to windows rot you are going to need office and you may never get up the budget to where you want to invest in office two thousand and ten or later for such a low-end often barely aero-capable pc so this is perfect as long as you temper your expectations.with properly set expectations and a legal copy of office two thousand and seven home and student you can now get down to how it works.it works by running basic word excel powerpoint and onenote tasks it is not going to wow you like a new version of office but a common thread i have read in hundreds of reviews for various versions and editions of office is why do they break what works in the previous version when they release a new version well by buying an older version there are no surprises as regards what office can and cannot do because it is been around for however many years it is been since the date the version in question office two thousand and seven home and student which is seven years as of when i write this was made.what can it actually do well word's fully featured as long as you are using it for home or student use excel is fully featured as regards the base program again the same caveat applies powerpoint will get your presentations done although you will miss some of the customizations of later versions onenote is fully featured and it along with powerpoint have the caveat that they are for home or student use the only thing that really lacks in home and student versus let us say ultimate which i use for troubleshooting through over-engineering is the microsoft office tools-you cannot expect fancy things like business contact manager and the accompanying copy of sql server two thousand and five express.in case you are wondering i am reviewing this for my aunt and uncle who sat there and bought a pc in may of two thousand and nine and thanks to a certain ability i have to troubleshoot combined with them buying retail windows seven home premium upgrade through the best buy fulfillment of the windows seven upgrade option that was current at the time along with retail office two thousand and seven home and student that they beat out of hp's customer dis service-albeit with having to pay for it i get to and thoroughly enjoy troubleshooting their pc whenever it is having an issue because i am on a mission to keep them off of the crack windows that is windows 8/ rt /8 one rt 8.1 windows phone 8x windows phone 8.1 x and i thoroughly enjoy every time i can fix their pc that uses this software.office two thousand and seven home and student was a change for them at first from the wordperfect office suite they were using on their old xp computer a dell dimension two thousand , four hundred they replaced it with an amd athlon sixty-four x2 seven thousand , seven hundred and fifty 4gb ram 500gb hd hp pavilion slimline s5120y but then again so was vista and then seven they did not have too much trouble with vista but windows seven home premium combined with this version of office makes them able to do everything they would ever want to do with office and a pc when that changes they will upgrade-and so far it is not changing i just think that office two thousand and seven whether lowly home and student or mighty ultimate or something in between like professional did not deserve the reputation it got as regards the ribbon people were and some still are so angry about the ribbon that they do not like office because of the ribbon i know i am not as qualified as some people to speak due to my aversion to command line interfaces whether of the old school dos unix variety or whether of the newfangled windows powershell variety but i know this for a fact once i properly configured their pc with windows seven home premium retail upgrade on a clean install and reimported their programs files and settings they were using it productively as could be until a virus hit that forced them to pay someone way too much to repair their computer i was able to set it right and from the moment i first showed them how to do basic things like bold underline italics margins indentation in other words showed them where microsoft office two thousand and seven home and student put the tools they were using in wordperfect office they have been happily using office with the ribbon i hate to discount those who have had negative experiences with office two thousand and seven because i do not like most change-especially not the licensing restrictions growing ever tighter since two thousand but i have not had any problems with the ribbon either.so with the ribbon discounted for us and our family we can now move on to infinitely more pressing matters which is how does office specifically two thousand and seven home and student perform in real world tasks well it does not make you have to renew the usage rights to it every year it supports the docx xlsx pptx trio and it has a user interface that aside from being different is actually usable if you can figure out what each button on each section of the ribbon is for which tooltips really help with that and they are on by default in summation for the reasons outlined above microsoft office two thousand and seven home and student is worth the money if you can get a legal copy i recommend it as long as it is needs match up well with what you need out of specifically microsoft office take this as you will two families experiences with office two thousand and seven one ultimate one home and student which is positive and we continue to use office two thousand and seven to this day",3.0,1.0,"VB PRP VB DT JJ CC NN NN NN JJ NN IN

1500,my jagged path to ubuntu ... i am not a professional developer nor am i that linux savvy before this distribution i have only had some minor linux experience trying to install off floppy disks which the build could not read my modem so i trashed that idea and went back to windows.flash forward a dozen years my heap of a desktop that was almost as old as my daughter took a dump on me since this was my only means of computing at the time i formatted and reinstalled xp off the disk i had for years i came to realize that it did not have any of the drivers for my ethernet card and i could not get online rather than steal someone else's laptop to burn drivers i figured i would give linux one more shot since it has gotten better over the years i ordered this set with my phone since the price was fair.like the low rated review i thought this was a four dvd install but i am not that disappointed that it is not what you really get is a thirty-two bit dvd sixty-four bit dvd a intro to linux dvd and a library dvd obviously i do not need both install disks but i may use the sixty-four bit on my laptop we just got.my ubuntu review i am currently running it on an old dell with five hundred and twelve mb ram connected to a forty-seven vizio internet tv for a monitor yeah i do weird things like this i wanted a pc to net around with and stream content on my tv the install went very smoothly and ubuntu actually found everything on my computer with no issues mint linux could not find my sound card the programs i use for general stuff were already installed or they could be found on the file network and installed easily enough so everything made the transition easier to linux i am still getting used to the feel but overall it is not a bad alternative i looked through some other distros of linux and found some kde builds that are more like windows but they require ram i do not have in the end ubuntu offered the best environment to use given my resources.if you are new to linux and want to jump in this is a good start i had it up and running in no time and can do just about anything i did with windows visually it is not as pretty as the kde builds like fedora and the feel is like windows 3.1 but it is growing on me.if you are wanting to try different distros you can download them and burn the iso to disk yourself and save money anyone with an average idea on computers can do this.download iso fileburn image to diskboot from cd dvd to install many have a try it feature i would suggest playing around on an old pc first so you do not mess up data and keep

1573,"went to best buy to buy a new wiimote yesterday and saw this game i bought both came back and install it on my dell dimension nine thousand , two hundred which is about as pre-built as you can get right no vista driver problems for me right wrong two two giraffes wrong first i had to tell my antivirus and spyware software about a billion times to let secure-rom install second i installed it and rebooted third my dvd drive no longer works i am not sure what changed between bioshock and this game cause i bought bioshock and had no problem with secure-rom back then i bought bioshock full price and do not regret a single cent because i actually got to play bioshock i finished bioshock without even cracking it although i eventually did for a second play-through cause who wants to find the dvd everytime right review updated funny thing i never did install dead space again on my system i just cannot risk having securerom on it again since i actually do tons of work on it so here is a review of a cracked version of the game as opposed to the boxed copy which now sits next to other games i do not play anymore poor hl2 i think ea should have an option when you insert the disk that lets you chose between installing their drm version or downloading a cracked one i am joking but i totally am not the game runs nicely on my dell dimension nine thousand , two hundred which ran bioshock and cod four on high just fine if you compare it to pc exclusive titles you can tell the textures in this game is low quality nevertheless it has a nice polished look the controls are fine i tried it with my xbox three hundred and sixty control but just cannot bring myself to play any kind of fps without keyboard mouse the game forces the mouse turn rate so your character cannot magically turn one hundred and eighty degrees in half a second this did not bother me and i actually think it is a nice way to add some realism into the controls the overall experience is effective and addictive if not for the reasonthe developer stated they said it was mostly about psychological fear with help from shadows and music the game is actually mostly about enemies popping out or dropping down from ceilings they said it is about strategic dismemberment it is strategic the first five times by then it is more like habitual dismemberment shoot limbs for maximum damage does not require more iq than boom headshot nevertheless the game just flows very well and lots of little things are put into it to keep you in the game world ninety-nine of the time it is obvious the developers put a lot of thought into the interface and controls it is something new to the genre that future games can learn from so now having played the game i plan on replaying it on easy so i can just wack the enemies to death and then on hard to give myself more of a rush i think it is worth the money however a big part of the reason i think that is cause i played a cracked copy put together by the pirates which installed the game and not secure rom so i am very conflicted about the whole thing i definitely do not want any more secure rom nonsense but at the same time i am happy i bought the game to support more games like this on my pc i guess i will continue to buy games with secure rom if it is good enough like this one or bioshock but i will still be playing the vastly superior pirated copy

1673,"all the publicity controversy identity changing and bizarre personalities aside prince is one of the greatest musicians alive today yet when this phrase is uttered people immediately think that i must admire his ambiguous image and his funny dress-code instead of respecting his musical genius even though i have read as many articles and biographies about him i could find still i do not know him so i am not the one to discuss the real reason behind all the fuss he has been putting out since one thousand , nine hundred and ninety-two not that it matters much since to me the name prince stands for one thing music prince writes music he performs and on this department i absolutely love him simply put no one else i have listened to could flirt across so many genres of music and nail them being incredibly diverse yet so uniquely sounding more than often he surprised me with a song which i initially hated and ended up listening to the most while prince is celebrating his emancipation from major record label it has been increasingly difficult for the casual fans by all mean it does not imply we are any less enthusiastic about his music than the so called diehard fans since we either need to join the music club or having to constantly go on internet and track him down about his latest music venture and more than often realizing that he has changed his mind again call me old-fashioned but i still prefer to go to a music store pay for a well-packaged cd open it and put the cd on while i read the insert as easy downloading music on the computer is i much rather collect a genuine article from an artist on the other hand though i strongly disagree with record label alas film studio interfering with the artistic freedom i do believe the one thing they serve as a certain level of quality control while not saying prince's music released under warner bros are necessarily better they do feel more polished and easier to the ears and those are thesongs that game him the status he has today i do not agree that prince is a washed-out has been as many would claim cynically because i believe this is what prince is aiming for to evolve and mature out of the pop-culture domain what i do agree is if prince continue to change his music releasing scheme strategy he will soon lose more of the even most devoted fans.one reviewer said anyone with half a brain can tell one nite alone ... live is a pretentious album consists of studio overdubs i should really start searching around the house for that half a brain however i do think it would be much better if this box set is titled one nite alone tour collection instead of the misleading word live giving people impression that this is a single live performance other than that the songs that played here are stunning mostly jazzy-funk but there are some true gems on disc two where prince hugs the piano himself playing some of his most beloved hits like adore nothing compares two u and do me baby one of the biggest let down is that according to the accompanying booklet there are plenty more rare and great live performances which are sadly missing here live version of power fantastic is available somewhere but songs like bambi and paisley park where we would have gotten a chance to hear the man himself jamming up the guitar are extremely difficult to find with a box this size three more cds would not be redundant.even though most of the materials here are recycled pasted together from many different sessions of the tour and with the issue of overdubs in question i have to say this is one

1692,i was a bit skeptical about buying an aftermarket battery grip for my new canon eos rebel t2i 550d in other parts of the world but since using it i have nothing but good things to say about this part i recently took a short vacation to mt rushmore in the black hills of south dakota and had this grip installed for the entire three day trip i took hundreds of photos and a lot of video note also that i am not an old-school photographer that likes to use the viewfinder but rather prefer to use live view screen mode which eats the batteries much more quickly the batteries that came with the grip lasted for the first two days before running low i had another set and was able to keep on shooting i also like the included aa battery tray which gives you the option of powering the camera with six aa batteries which could be a real life saver in a pinch i would rate the feel fit finish and quality of this part to be on par with the camera itself the plastic and grip are nearly identical to the camera the controls function perfectly and make portrait position photos more comfortable than i have ever experienced i have large hands and the comfort factor is the biggest reason that i purchased this to begin with as the normal landscape position is more comfortable as well anyone who has picked up the t2i 550d knows instantly that it is not a heavy camera and actually is a bit on the lightweight side this grip with two batteries actually improves the balance by adding heft and size which can create a much better user experience the only thing i would caution is to consider buying the package with four batteries to allow for change-outs if you do not already have spares that said i highly recommend this product over the one hundred and seventy oem grip from canon which does not include extra batteries and even if you do not have the spare batteries you can get by on aas if you need to update 11/10 two thousand and ten i have now been using this battery grip for about four months and still have nothing but good things to say the rubberized grip has held up well with no noticeable signs of wear the battery life has not seemed to have diminished with time and use there have been some negative comments by other users but i still stand by my original comments update 4/12 two thousand and eleven this part has continued to hold up well the only thing i have noticed is that the printing on the grip by the buttons has worn somewhat as opposed to the printing on the camera itself which has held up with no noticeable wear clearly the manufacturing process at meike is not up to the same level as it is at canon that said i have enjoyed flawless performance from this part and it has not left my camera since i received it the batteries have held up equally

1719,i preordered this with my om-d em5 kit on amazon the second it was released february seven two thousand and twelve while the om-d is still nowhere to be seen no big deal i guess it is been only seventy-one days of wait after all the mmf three arrived last week and i unpacked it last night.first thing first all 4/3 to m43 adapters are mechanically the same there is no chip no electronics there are only pass-through electrical contacts the long story some mmf history you can skip to the end if you do not feel like reading the whole thing ): the mmf one came first it came at the time when there were almost no m43 lenses available and when a m43 user had to rely on his her 4/3 lens collection it was also the time when olympus was still expecting to be able to solve in a fast way the issue with m43 cameras being slow to focus with 4/3 lenses i am not inventing this af part it is all in the interviews with olympus techs popping up here and there throughout the years they really did not expect it to be that difficult the mmf one was awfully expensive for what it was but at least had this beautiful metal construction which sweetened the pill a bit then came the mmf two this was an adapter first released in a kit with the 4/3 40-150 mm lens it was a great deal as basically one of the items whichever side you look at it ended up being free given that the kit was at a mild one hundred and ninety-nine msrp.the mmf two was even more awfully expensive than the mmf one it weighed half the weight of the mmf one not a bad thing in itself but it had a flimsy plasticky construction to not help things once the mmf two 40-150 mm kit was discontinued that is once the m43 version of the 40-150 mm was released the price of the mmf two alone went to a whopping one hundred and ninety-nine msrp one hundred and fifty street price for what is basically a piece of plastic.to its defense by the time the mmf two was released olympus had already realized that making regular non cdaf optimized lenses focus fast on a m43 camera will not be that easy especially the swd lenses gee by that time they actually had problems with slow af on their main camera lens m43 combos problem which was only solved months down the line with firmware updates.it was by then clear that the 4/3 lenses in use with the m43 cameras will be only the cdaf optimized ones which all weigh close to nothing anyway so it was fine.enter the om-d em5 camera.this one is the hot one in oly's m43 lineup it is the first m43 camera body to be weather sealed to olympus credit they also released the mmf three adapter with it the mmf three is weather sealed and this is where it becomes interesting the weather sealed 4/3 lenses are for the most big and heavy well not all but most of the really interesting ones anyway so one would expect this adapter to have at least the mmf one s metal construction and solid feel.alas it was not to be the mmf three is a flimsy plasticky thing just as flimsy as the mmf two the mmf one construction is nowhere to be found it is basically an mmf two with an o-ring on the male side which is proof that this thing is expected to be used only with the 14-54 mm mk2 the only oly 4/3 lens to be weather sealed and cdaf optimized and which is not very heavy i know i know one should always handle a lens camera combo by its heaviest part meaning you are not supposed to carry your 35-100 mm zuiko with a panasonic gf three on it by the camera body of course not.still a heavy lens can put strain on the adapter when shifting in a bag you can in the heat of the moment shift weight between your arms and have a few seconds when the load goes on the camera body side you can ... stuff happens i would prefer a strong adapter vs a weak one any time i am not saying it will break on the spot i just do not feel secure using this thing with a heavy and expensive lens.the one that still laughs at all this the panasonic dmw-ma one lumix g 4/3 dslr mount adapter this baby is still selling is still a panasonic branded mmf one and still costs one hundred and fourteen the short story all 4/3 to m43 adapters function the same there are no electronics there just electrics the olympus mmf one expensive and the the panasonic dmw-ma one the least expensive of all brand name adapters have solid metal construction the olympus mmf two has flimsy plastic construction the new olympus mmf three is a weather sealed mmf two not a weather sealed mmf one there is a chinese alternative the jjc something which is even less expensive than the the panasonic dmw-ma one and is said to be a copy of the mmf one not of the mmf two the jury is still out as of whether the mmf two is actually flimsy enough to cause concern as with everything olympus it is up to specs and does what it is intended to do it is just that it has that flimsy feel and look update just stumbled on this description on the global olympus website released february eight two thousand and twelve :\ four thirds mount adapter mmf 3this adapter has the same function as the mmf one and mmf two adapters designed for use in mounting a four thirds lens on a micro four thirds camera body the mmf three features the same dust splash-proof construction as the camera when one of the twelve dust splash-proof zuiko digital lenses of the shg super high grade or hg high grade series is mounted on the olympus om-d by means of the mmf three pictures with incomparably high image quality can be manifested even under severe environments.the adapter has a detachable tripod mount so safe operation is possible even when a large-aperture lens is used love the detachable tripod mount part something definitely got lost along the way didn'tit :d enjoy this announcement while it lasts i

1838,apple needs competition as it stands without any real competition apple will continue to practice their dirty business techniques and hold back features that consumers want need in their products knowing that people will buy them anyway then offer those features next year as new upgrades what am i talking about the camera taking 0.7 megapixel still shots for starters this is absolutely unacceptable for two thousand and ten i know that the ipod's camera is not meant to be a replacement for your digital camera but at 0.7 megapixels it is pretty pointless if you ask me i think they just took the old cameras out of the older ipod nano's and used them the more i think of it the camera upgrades in the new ipod touch are the cameras that should have been introduced last year in the 3rd generation ipod touch there is no reason why apple could not have put in the same five megapixel camera w led flash as they did in the iphone four the only reason they did not to save this feature for next years upgrade oh yeah perhaps because they chose to make the ipod touch 0.07 slimmer than before too because everyone was complaining about how thick the ipod touch was right i am sure if apple would have introduced the new ipod touch 4th generation as being as thick as say the iphone four with the better camera fitting inside nobody would have been complaining that it is too thick second enough of the glossy metal backs apple we are tired of the scratch prone backs it is getting old sure there are tons of cases out there but again if you would have made the new ipod touch follow the design of the new iphone four we would not need to worry about that highly scratch prone backside of course come next years ipod touch update refresh we will see this new design being implemented you will see hear apple say ... we have a brand new design .. completely changing it is looks .. etc next issue why still offer the 8gb 32gb 64gb models that is three straight years now oh yeah because apple does not have any real competition in the ipod market to rival this so they just keep it here until they have to upgrade it to 32gb 64gb 128gb pricing for flash memory of these sizes would not have significantly increase apples costs they could have done it if they wanted to but did not way to think first for your mass amount of consumers apple of course the new ipod touch does have some good new additions that are welcoming thus the reason for two stars not just one upgraded to the new retina display nice touch no complaints there the cheap little front camera for face time again cool nice touch however this is just as beneficial to apple as it is to the consumers apple would love for consumers to use their video chat face time and get more and more people using their products to be able to communicate with their peers think about it iphone four users using face time with ipod touch users and soon the ipad two will have cameras thus face time with those users .. and by then i am sure apple will allow face time to work with their laptops imacs too how perfect for apple .. all of their products will offer face time it is an old strategy but it will work it will sucker users into their little game even though ichat has been around the typical consumer is brainwashed by apples buzzwords and marketing tactics finally and i am almost ashamed to admit this this review is coming from an apple user fan i love apple i love their products but i do not like the little game they play with consumers holding back features now just to introduce them later for their next generations this is dirty business but without any real competition it is what they can afford to do knowing that people will buy their products anyway i for one have held back for years buying an ipod touch first it was because they were not offering enough storage then because there was not a camera now well there is sort of a camera but still it is just not offering all that it should i do not will not buy any product or service that lacks features i want that is the power of being the consumer and trust me i will not cave when i feel that the ipod touch offers all the features i want if i still see value in that product i will buy perhaps next year perhaps but i am sure they will do some similar type of holding back on a feature it would not surprise me time will tell of course if consumers exercised their powers chose not to buy into apple's little game it would force apple to make offer better products for their consumers but that is just asking for way too much from the average consumer they will buy just about anything apple offers and then re-buy it the next year .. and then the next year .. etc sad,0.0,0.0,NN VBZ NN IN PRP VBZ IN DT JJ NN NN MD VB TO

1915,i have used tax cut in the past and have been satisfied but i read about download install issues with tax cut this year and decided to try turbo tax i found turbo tax to be very rigid for example my wife donates to twenty-five thirty different charities each year with tax cut they just required the name of the charity and amount turbo tax requires an address for every charity if i left the address off tt would not allow that donation to be added now i have the cancelled checks for all these charities but i had to look up every address on the net in order to enter these deductions into turbo another example is that my wife has a sar sep for her business that retirement plan allows a catch-up deduction which the standard sep plan does not allow turbo does not provide a sar sep option and would not allow me to enter a catch-up deduction to the sep calculation tax cut does not support a sar sep either but tax cut gives the option to enter the deduction amount for sar sep that you self-calculate so these are two examples where i had to go through extraordinary efforts to work through turbo's rigidity they seem to think that if turbo does not support it you do not need it at least allow me to add or over-ride at my own risk there were others that i will not go into here i also was disappointed with intuit's itsdeductible web site this site is advertised as a place to

particularly love the virtual copy feature that allows you to create and easily manage multiple versions all while taking significantly less space than creating real copies of the files we are still learning all the editing capabilities we have not taken the plunge into photoshop cs yet but we are photoshop elements users most of what we used to do in elements is now easier in lightroom it used to take so long to open every photo in elements and make necessary improvements but now we can easily apply certain changes to large groups quickly or even go through one at a time far more quickly than before and for any of the few changes that must be done in elements which so far has just been healing-brush-type work it is just a couple of clicks away to create a virtual copy and open it in elements i think what is both the most daunting and impressive about lightroom is the flexibility there is a huge number of organizational tools provided and there is no one way to organize your photos and your workflow with them especially when you integrate it with other tools this felt a bit overwhelming at first but as you learn about what is available you can really start to develop and tailor your own workflow to fit your preferences and needs there are a few small drawbacks i have had the application crash a few times and some operations are pretty slow particularlyexporting a large number of edited photos which is the main downside to the nondestructive editing scheme however it is getting about time for a new computer so hopefully a newer faster machine will improve the

2089,notice do not buy this title w o going through the first one it will make this game way more enjoyable and you will understand the beginning you can consider this title as a 14th century gta tons of stuff to do outside of the main story tons of places to explore same engine used in the cut-scenes is used in the game tons of hidden things insane ways to kill enemies and screw around with the pedestrians they also react very well to your actions the peds improvement over the first title are massive though the xbox version actually runs and looks a hair better than the ps3 version it is still very enjoyable and a full fledged ride of fun and beauty against a gorges score which i think is available on cd i will definitely pick it up very memorable melodies epically that villa one it is technically more difficult to make a transfer of a game onto the ps3 platform for some reason this title on the ps3 has a very light blur glow filter throughout the game it gives it a nice wary warm feeling but it seems to be an attempt to hide other visual issues in the game again the xbox transfer does not have this effect i think still like i said it is really fun pop-in galore the major downfall of this game it is not occasionally it is all the time seems to be more so with vegetation it is very bothersome sometimes like when you are flying through the country side on horseback you see chunks of grass weeds bushes pop-in right in front of you then these pop-ins have a second more detailed layer that overlaps these pop-ins and it is just annoying sometimes this was not common on the previous title this is why i gave a rating of four stars many of the ps3 frame-rate issues from the previous title are fixed in this sequel which is evidence the developers are listening i believe though some horizontal screen splitting is still there when you rotate your camera around ezio on a tall building not too annoying though i was hoping this was fixed because it was in the previous title a-lot everything else is hella fun and amazing great story directly related to the previous game italian renaissance for the first time in games is absolutely beautiful and you feel the atmosphere seriously just simply walking around is entertaining partial spolier :: double-blading an enemy in the eyes makes you quiver and also when you smash in a guys balls while he is on the

available on cd i will definitely pick it up very memorable melody epically that villa one it be technically more difficult to make a transfer of a game onto the ps3 platform for some reason this title on the ps3 have a very light blur glow filter throughout the game it give it a nice wary warm feeling but it seem to be a attempt to hide other visual issue in the game again the xbox transfer do not have this effect i think still like i say it be really fun pop-in galore the major downfall of this game it be not occasionally it be all the time seem to be more so with vegetation it be very bothersome sometimes like when you be fly through the country side on horseback you see chunk of grass weed bush pop-in right in front of you then these pop-in have a second more detailed layer that overlap these pop-in and it be just annoying sometimes this be not common on the previous title this be why i give a rating of four star many of the ps3 frame-rate issue from the previous title be fix in this sequel which be evidence the developer be listen i believe though some horizontal screen splitting be still there when you rotate you camera around ezio on a tall building not too annoying though i be hope this be fix because it be in the previous title a-lot everything else be hella fun and amazing great story directly related to the previous game italian renaissance for the first time in game be absolutely beautiful and you feel the atmosphere seriously just simply walk around be entertaining partial spolier : : double-blade a enemy in the eye make you quiver and also when you smash in a guy ball while he be on the ground make my jaw drop lol end : : anyway buy it now i will pre-order the final assassin creed title when it come hope they really take they time on it,470

2172,i am a veteran of home video editing biz i used several tools before ulead was one of them i bought cyberlink pd delux eight a few weeks ago and made two home dvds of my family vacation dvs with total two hours of playing time from my experience i found there are some very good features with pd compared to ulead it is very intuitive one can almost plug and play without refering users guide there is not one anyway or i did not find one available multiple video audio tracks a lot of cool transfers fancy stuff easy to render and burn dvds the only headache i had was that the software crushes a lot during editing my system is windows vista thirty-two bit 4g ram 1ghz 20g storage space my video card is a little bottle neck with windows 3.4 index rating it is not perfect for video editing of course but no reason for software crush either or at least there should be a waring message telling me that my system is insufficient no such warnings the software just crushes in middle of my project sometimes just after i click on a button it was very frustrating then i did everything i could to free up enough memory and clicking on buttons like stepping in mine field yes you have to click and wait till you see your project name on top changes from xxx.prj to xxx.prj that sign means system is still busy saving or doing data swaping and hint-message under your cursor shows up then you can move you mouse otherwise software will crush right away so you must wait at least two seconds after each click of the mouse the 2nd worst thing is that video footage may get lost and leaves some random black holes in the time line cyberlink tech support said it was because my footages were from ups flash card drive and they do not support that maybe that was it the 3rd worst thing is that cyberlink tech support hotline is not free i did not know that when you have any tech question and want to make a phone call for answer it is like those phone-sex lines youhave to pay for it thirty-eight per month i really do not like it or you can email and get an initial answer and go back and forth from there each eamil answer takes two to three days bottom line is it is a good

2180,"the teares of the muses the new york university collegium viol consort directed by margaret panofsky with kathleen cantrell and campbell rightmyer sopranos and morwaread farbood organ has just released its cd ein lammlein 17th century german passion music the cd is both very well constructed and very moving in meditations on the death of christ and its significance the viol consort margaret panofsky and caroline marris treble david fenton tenor jeremy brandt-young bass christina brandt-young continuo bass has been in residency at st michael's episcopal church in new york city since two thousand and seven members include both nyu faculty and students and nyu community viol players the central work on the cd ein lammlein geht und tragt die schuld is a lament in five sections on christ's death written by samuel capricornus 1628-1665 for two sopranos viol consort and continuo the opening work o traurigkeit o herzeleid for the same combination is also by capricornus the two pieces were published in one thousand , six hundred and sixty in a volume titled zwey lieder von dem leyden und tode jesu two songs on the suffering and death of jesus the works of capricornus are not well known although according to the article in new grove they are deserving of more study and performance like schutz who praised his work and tunder capricornus often chose to employ the viol consort with his vocal textures he is known to have written theatre music now lost however his gift for expressive detail is evident in the two works presented here the two texts are by different poets the first o traurigkeit was written by friedrich spee von langenfeld 1591-1635 a jesuit priest ein lammlein is by paul gerhardt poet and hymn writer the texts share an exclamatory quality setting off emotional gestures oh great woe oh sweet mouth oh wonder o traurigkeit has a simple structure of eight five-line stanzas with consistent rhyme and meter the opening sinfonia is repeated after the fourth stanza capricornus does not linger over the text after an opening duet each voice has a solo verse delivered almost conversationally in spite of the solemnity of the subject the sorrow of christ's death and the sins of mankind in verse five there is a striking harmonic crunch on the word mourn beklagen ); in verse seven the viol consort is brought in making brief exclamatory exhalations as the body is lowered into the grave with gentle triplets from the singers ein lammlein a longer work has greater variety a basic ten line stanza is established and then disturbed in the first two sections the opening section the longest contains a bit of dramatic action god asks jesus to go forth and bear the sins of his children and christ responds that he is willing to carry the load the second verse o wunderlieb o liebesmacht marvels at christ's sacrifice the two stanzas are shorter the viols again repeat their introductory sinfonia between the two verses and then play in the second verse highlighting the falling gestures of the voices at the pouring forth of the lamb's noble blood the final three sections are a personal response to the sacrifice and love that the crucifixion represents the speaker desires to keep christ as a friend to relinquish the gold of arabia and its spices to be nourished and guided by christ and finally at death to be placed at his side the beautifully bejeweled bride is splendidly bedecked by the full consort of viols these two works each full of interest easily stand by themselves however the cd is enhanced still further with works for viol consort one also with voice by a variety of contemporaneous german composers between each section of the vocal music after the final chord of o traurigkeit the viols enter with a chord of almost identical sonority thus beginning schein's suite no one from banchetto musicale the ensuing instrumental texture viols out from under wraps is further enlivened withornaments on the repeat--trills starting on the note graceful turns and connecting passagi carefully considered and placed are evident throughout the recording and suggestive of a distinctly germanic style after the dialogue between god and jesus the intrad and lamento by david funck provide a brief but likewise dramatic interlude with fast-slow stop-start motion suitably exclamatory the third interlude transcribed from scheidt's organ chorale and variation no five da jesus an dem kreuze stund prepares by its use of chromaticism the fourth interlude tunder's exquisite an wasserflussen babylon the opening phrases of the five viols establish a rich tonal world which the singer enters with another different lament the hanging of the harps on the willow trees the final interlude a small gem from the st matthew passion by johann sebastiani 1622-1683 o welt ich muss dich lassen oh world i must leave you borrows its melody from another famous song of leavetaking innsbruck ich muss dich lassen from the first the singers captivate with expressive open wonderfully blended sound the themes of the recording are complex and interesting and these singers make repeated listening a real pleasure the continuo team is also very fine the bass viol is consistently attentive to the gestures of the music the viol consort functions impressively as a single entity coordinated at repeats and moments of heightened emotion yet each individual voice is clear the liner notes by margaret panofsky are thorough and provide a springboard for further research texts and translations are well laid out and easy to follow although passion music is associated with a specific time of the year the uplifting quality of the music and performance on this cd belongs to a timeless season",3.0,1.0,"DT NNS IN DT

for a while on getting the ten fearing that they would be too small i bit the bullet a few weeks ago and they were snug but i thought i would give them a try and decided to wear them out of the house no turning back after a couple hours in them my feet would go numb so i took them to a shoe repair shop to have them stretched after three days on the stretcher with leather stretching solution they felt a lot better the night i picked them up however they shrank back and are still too small and are too uncomfortable to wear all day also they arrive with a very cheesy grey finish sprayed on them removing it was pretty easy just about fifteen minutes with a towel and some elbow grease i still have my pair of brown twelve harness frye usa boots from high school and love them but i was saddened to see that these frye boots were made in mexico the grey spray notwithstanding the overall quality of materials and craftsmanship is satisfactory to be expected for the i just wish they fit like my other frye boots oh well if you decide to order them make certain that they fit very well before deciding to keep them as attempting to stretch them has proven to be futile also keep in mind that you

both username and password voila luckily i didn ’ t wait for customer service to respond to my question about this … three days later i still haven ’ t received a reply.the biggest problem with this camera is its very weak internal antenna there ’ s no possibility of adding an external antenna the camera needs to be very close to a router or extender to work properly i have the camera closer to a router than one of my computers which uses a usb wi-fi adapter the computer connects beautifully to a router upstairs but the movo camera can ’ t even connect properly to the extender in the next room the router upstairs is utterly hopeless for the camera judging by the signal strength indicators inside the user interface there shouldn ’ t be a problem connecting i think the camera ’ s signal strength indicator bars are totally misleading there ’ s not enough signal strength to do anything with this camera totally useless video appears as frozen images because nothing moves unless the

2370,i will say up front that for me this is a high-priced item i am not an audiophile i just want good sound that will fill the room both for tv watching and listening to music after reading reviews i decided to pickup this speaker for use in my finished basement for a few reasons first i have brick walls so running a bunch of speaker wire is not easy and will not look great and second because we do a lot of entertaining in that space and having bluetooth capability makes it easy to play and control music this speaker fits that criteria and i am very pleased with how well it performs.out of the box i was surprised by how solidly built it is i had read the specifications but i have to say i was surprised by the weight it just feels like a quality unit my intent was not to use it as a portable device so it is weight and size does not bother me.from the other comments common concerns with this speaker and probably all single units this size seem to be stereo separation and bass i did not expect amazing stereo separation from a single unit but sitting in front of my tv where this speaker faces i am really impressed at how this nearly does the job of the two bookshelf speakers it replaced which were spaced four apart i have no complaints as far as that is concerned as bass goes i am equally impressed by the lows this puts out very happy about that.for design the thing just looks great i assumed it would look nice but sitting on the shelf it really stands out it goes perfect with our decor and has both a modern and classic feel so i would not hesitate putting it in any room i will take performance first but it is a bonus that it is so attractive to look at.as someone else mentioned the inactivity power off is a bit of a double-edged sword for me truthfully i would like this to happen when i leave the room and forget to power it off and i am glad it does work that way but it would be great if i could auto-activate it back up when using my computer or phone not a huge deal more laziness on my part.overall i am incredibly happy with this unit it is perfect for my need.vate it back up when using my computer or phone not a huge deal more laziness on my

2420,i received this globe a year ago as a gift for my children they occasionally would take it out and spend time with it but only recently has one of my sons started getting serious about independently studying geography so he asked me to update the globe for him that was when what had become a pleasant household educational device became a nightmare when i first registered i was delighted to see that i would qualify for free updates for a year from the date of registration rather then from purchase date so i plugged in my pen started the software and suddenly like others have reviewed found myself with a useless smart pen the program managed to wipe the pen's memory but refused to download the new information into the pen it gave me a dozen different error messages i tried turning off my firewall uninstalling reinstalling everything turning off my antivirus etc ... nothing worked i was left with a dead pen it just made this horrible faint scratching clicking sound i tried updating it on my husband's pc and after a couple of tries finally got it to finish downloading into the pen ... unfortunately it was the 5-8 yr old info way too young for my kids against my better judgement i tried downloading the age appropriate info thankfully it worked after the update was complete it automatically updated the clock.the globe itself is sturdy attractive and well designed and the kids really enjoy it it does not feel or look cheap we keep it on top of our bookshelf in our living room because it looks nice enough to do so oregon scientific really should deal with the software issue because they have something special here but as it is right now it is something of a trojan horse if the pen does not work you will be left with a nice yet way overpriced globe

2499,i was very disappointed with this game the basic idea you play a detective working alongside lenny briscoe and then an ada working alongside the jack's latest assistant is sound but the gameplay is a complete anathema to the tv show in the tv show the detectives follow up blind alleys in their quest for the truth in the game if you follow a blind alley you must immediately load a saved game or you will run out of time or simply lose.in essence much of the early game comprises searching for physical evidence and questioning witnesses while trying to save time the fact that it takes fifteen minutes to bag a cigarette butt is extremely stupid since it means that to collect the right evidence and yet not run out of time you need to play the game over and over to figure out which evidence you need and then go back and psychically only pick up the right evidence needless to say key evidence is carefully obscured by a bad user interface e g a house full of drawers that do not open and one that does but needs to be opened using a key that is in the victim's wallet but itself hidden by the user interface interviewing suspects is even worse whether or not you should ask a given question is totally arbitrary and if you do not ask the right questions your game is over but you will have to figure that out by yourself e g one of the first puzzles in the game involves piecing together a torn up business card just having the pieces with the address phone number or name of the company is not enough what is more there is a witness nearby and the only question worth asking that witness is would you move your vehicle so you can find the last piece of that card.remember if you make a mistake you need to restore from backup so apparently the only good detective or ada is psychic and knows for example that the mineral water has a usable print on it but the cigarette lighter does not sadly you may be psychic but you cannot get lab reports by phone orfax or look up people's addresses in the telephone directory.even worse if for some reason an interview with a witness ends without letting you ask a crucial question you may not be allowed to re-interview that witness even if you uncover evidence contradicting one of their statements i would probably have equally nasty observations to make about the ada portion of the game but i refuse to play it further.finally some quibbles it is not a 3d game everything is pre-rendered so it is a 2d game with pre-rendered video of 3d figures instead of live actors presumably to save money i actually thought
