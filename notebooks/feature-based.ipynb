      "REVIEW: my computer was infected with the browser hijacker virus downloaded the virus with a free program while i was able to remove the bulk of the virus the mcafee already installed in my computer was not able to remove the residual files so my browser was still redirected a lot very annoying i used total defense it was able to remove everything on the first scan however i think it is too restrictive so it blocked out a lot of the internet connections so i had trouble even reading my emails i had to remove it and reinstall my mcafee but it did solve my biggest problem--killing the virus so three stars i do think if i am more computer savvy maybe i can modify the settings to make it work GOLD 3 PREDICTED: 0 \n",

      "REVIEW: despite the fact that the ui could use some improvements i think this mmo has vast potential far more potential than ffxi had upon it is release i played ffxi for six years and i think some people forget how bare bones it was on the initial release the game is visually stunning beautiful even i am unsure how some people could be so harsh with their judgements so quickly this is a mmorpg and in my experience with mmos they are ever evolving with updates expansions and add-ons people say the game is not complete but what mmorpg is complete when you have update after update and numerous expansions and add-ons i do not think a mmo is ever complete those who gave up on this treasure too soon have made a mistake i fear this is definately a mmo masterpiece in the works GOLD 1 PREDICTED: 3 \n",

      "REVIEW: i have used pcs forever that is until about eight months ago i bought a macbook running tiger and a new laptop pc w vista at the same time i became familiar with the macbook pretty quickly and actually found myself using it over the pc ninety of the time then i upgraded to the latest os of leopard and have been using it since the end of october i have been gradually going back to the pc more and more as leopard is really more complicated than i expected i am considering going back to tiger but i have sunk so much money and time installing the new os in the macbook i think i will just wait until they fix a few of the problems and go back to the pc for a while if you have to choose between vista and tiger ... go with tiger but if it is a choice between vista and leopard ... go with vista until some of the gripes in leopard are fixed imho if you want to know what those gripes are just do a google search on leopard and grab a cup of coffee ... your in for a long read sure there are those mac people who will defend the os but there are fewer than you would expect even mac loyal sites are posting tons of complaints instead of praise to me being familiar with both pc and mac it is obvious that apple is trying to be more like a pc it is a shame because that is why i liked tiger ... it was not microsoft oh well bill gates wins we all lose GOLD 0 PREDICTED: 3 \n",

      "REVIEW: this is cheap junk versus the seemingly identical product from a different manufacturer on stage stands which is the one you should buy this musician's gear knockoff of the on stage stands product has an inferior design with poor fit-and-finish worse yet the geometry of the adjustable neck is off so that the back of my dreadnought acoustic guitar's body touches the unpadded neck of the stand before the guitar's neck makes contact with the padded upper support no matter how i adjust the stand's neck height unlike the superior on stage stands version the foam padding on the musician's gear stand stinks like foul chemicals not surprising since there is a prominent warning tag attached that says the foam might deteriorate the finish of any instrument having a nitrocellulous lacquer finish my dreadnought guitar and with height adjusted my tenor ukulele both fit the on stage stands stand but neither fits this one the foam coverings on the oss version are neatly and precisely attached and the circular ends of the rubber stretch lock on the upper support snap neatly into their own recessed channels which this musician's gear version lacks so the rubber lock just slides clumsily over the foam i will be looking for inexpensive return freight so i can get a credit from the vendor rather than just throwing this purchase into the trash to the vendor's credit the agent i obtained my return-authorization from was willing to give me a price match one discount on an on stage stands replacement though i decided to buy instead from sweetwater dot com where i bought my first oss item update the return policy of the vendor different now on amazon vs mine allows it to deduct the value of my initially free shipping from the credit it would issue therefore my ten purchase price apparently would be reduced by 4.95 vendor's standard 3-5- day shipping plus my cost for return freight which i assume would be at least five ergo i am better off throwing this crappy item in the trash rather than returning it so the vendor could resell it to another sucker lesson learned caveat emptor further update i emailed a copy of my amazon review to the vendor's front office along with a further expression of displeasure and they responded by apologizing and issuing a full refund confirmed by amazon without requiring i return the product i recommend all consumers speak up when they have been screwed over the better vendors will make amends GOLD 0 PREDICTED: 3 \n",

      "REVIEW: i have been using bitdefender for the past couple of years i found the two thousand and eight version for three computers for two years at a great price when it was running out i went looking for a similar deal and found one i noticed a couple of unpolished elements when installing there were a lot of dos command prompt windows opening in the background on the screen very briefly i did not have to interact with any of them and they went away almost immediately so there is no harm to it it is just a little unpolished i should also mention that the update for it is big it will ask to download the updated installer then after a few minutes when that is downloaded and run the updates for the program are currently over seventy-five mb i think that is probably the case with many anti-virus programs but just be aware if you are on dial-up you will be downloading for quite some time i uninstalled that old from a laptop and a desktop the desktop went fine but the laptop failed to uninstall i tried to get the uninstall program off bitdefender's website but the link they pointed to was dead eventually i found the cd and reinstalled which failed but the cd had the uninstaller which worked i only mention this because it is a little worrisome that if the last program had those issues that this version might when i eventually uninstall it i like this version of the program it has several different modes ranging from novice hides settings to expert showing all of it and is very easy to change between them my absolute favorite part though is the you are not fully protected system in past programs i have used if you disable some feature you constantly get the little alert icon that you are at risk bitdefender two thousand and ten lets you choose which of those things it monitors for so i did not want the anti-spam because i only use web mail so i told it not to bother me that i would deleted it it may be a small thing but to me it is a huge annoyance saver.so far i cannot tell if the scanner is faster or not it scans at only about a quarter of the number of files per second as the old program but it supposedly has an intelligent monitoring system which lets it avoid rescanning files that have not changed and thus could not have picked up an infection so while it was not that fast on the first scan in theory it will only get faster moving forward it intentionally skipped thousands of files.default is a daily scan which in my opinion is complete overkill unless you have a kid in your house if the resident protection is running all the time you can get by with once or twice a week thankfully the scheduling is very easy and you can even set the scans to take low priority which is a nice touch.in terms of detection bitdefender is not the highest rated scanner but it is far from the lowest it is an excellent budget anti-virus package and more than adequate for most people's needs considering how reasonable the pricing is i would happily recommend however since i have only used it a week or so if it does do anything really weird i will update my review to mention it.update 8/ 3/10- finally had to use my printer and guess what bitdefender has killed it i cannot use my network printer so i am dropping this review a couple stars i killed its firewall and turned the windows one on again guess what i can print again i wasted two hours dealing trying to fix it before i gave up unacceptable behavior in a firwall.ce saver so far i cannot tell if the scanner is faster or not it scans at only about a quarter of the number of files per second as the old program but it supposedly has an intelligent monitoring system which lets it avoid rescanning files that have not changed and thus could not have picked up an infection so while it was not that fast on the first scan in theory it will only get faster moving forward it intentionally skipped thousands of files default is a daily scan which in my opinion is complete overkill unless you have a kid in your house if the resident protection is running all the time you can get by with once or twice a week thankfully the scheduling is very easy and you can even set the scans to take low priority which is a nice touch in terms of detection bitdefender is not the highest rated scanner but it is far from the lowest it is an excellent budget anti-virus package and more than adequate for most people's needs considering how reasonable the pricing is i would happily recommend however since i have only used it a week or so if it does do anything really weird i will update my review to mention it update 8/ 3/10 finally had to use my printer and guess what bitdefender has killed it i cannot use my network printer so i am dropping this review a couple stars i killed its firewall and turned the windows one on again guess what i can print again i wasted two hours dealing trying to fix it before i gave up unacceptable behavior in a firwall GOLD 0 PREDICTED: 3 \n",
