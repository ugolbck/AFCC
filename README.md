# AFCC - Automated Feedback Constructiveness Classifier

Project aims:
- Show the possibility to classify text based on their constructiveness
- Compare different models (SOTA and outdated) and different sets of features
- Show that it is possible to use constructiveness as an alternative to inter-user (biased) helpfulness votes

Project main steps:
- Data collection/annotation
- Feature selection for non-neural models
- Neural network models
- Result collection and analysis
