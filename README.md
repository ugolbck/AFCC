# AFCC - Automated Feedback Constructiveness Classifier

Author: **Ugo Loobuyck**
Purpose: **Master's Thesis**

Project aims:
- Show the possibility to classify feedback reviews based on constructiveness:
    - Provide a valid and reliable constructiveness scale.
    - Compare different models, different sets of features and numberof features.
    - Compare our scale results with binary classification and out-of-domain data.

## Data collection

### Training data



### Test data

The test data sets will be collected later on, from different sources.

**Aim**: Test efficiency on both in-domain and out-of-domain data

## Data Annotation

TODO:
- Define a constructivenes scale (4 classes to be able to compare with previous binary work)
- Survey for annotation agreement
  - Google form with 20 reviews
  - Explain in detail each possible annotation
  - Included a question on English speaking level (A/B/C/native)
- Annotate at least 10000 reviews

## Machine learning models
