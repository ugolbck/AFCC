4,This is my favorite cyanoacrylate gap filling glue. The only problem is the tip gets clogged between each use and you run the risk of tearing the tip off when the black cap gets very stuck. This seems to be a common shortcoming of most cyanoacrylate glues. They stick so well there is no way to protect the opening.,c,d,10

13,"Playing with scores is completely optional. Played many times with fellow adults, and it was fast/easy/loud enough that none of us cared about keeping score -- we just liked to play the rounds. The minute that starts to get boring, however, you can add strategy and start keeping the scores.<br /><br />Also, adjusts easily to different size groups, and is simple enough that rules / play can be modified, if you desire something more clever.",d,d,10
14,"Both the film and this new DVD edition from Fear Factory are 5 star efforts. The movie is an enjoyable and creepy little tale about an old goon who makes Silver Shamrock masks that causes mutations for those who wear them. It reminded me of the Creepshow films and personally I found it really inventive. Personally I consider it a plus that it didn't feature the dull Michael Myers again and would probably be much better thought of if it didn't have the Halloween series badge hanging over it.

This amazing new DVD edition contains many new extra features that were not on the previous releases. These include 2 audio commentaries, an extensive 'making of' documentary and a visit to the filming locations (and more!)

I think time has been kind to Halloween 3 and I hope that as it is looking and sounding better than ever, more people will re-evaluate this dark little tale and get as much enjoyment from it as I do.",d,d,10
15,"Bought these so that it would help keep the water in the tube colder during my hikes. Nothing like having ice cold water in the hydration pack but your first drink it hot as you suck on the tubing to get a drink. After installing it, I tried it out and it really didn't make a difference. Water was still warm and had to spit it out and draw on tubing to get to cold water. When you're on long hikes, all the water you carry it precious. It was worth a try but wouldn't recommend it.",c,c,6

18,"A while ago I gave this product a 2/5 and basically crapped on it because I misunderstood what I wanted from it. I had figured that this product, touting its ""EMI/RFI attenuation"", would eliminate the interference I was experiencing on my studio monitors, and was quite upset when it failed to deliver.

A year or so later, I managed to finally fix the interference by fixing an issue entirely unrelated to the power supply. Oops.

I was prepared to just throw a 4/5 at this by way of apology and call it even, but I actually ended up buying a couple more of these when I needed to find a road-portable power strip that I wouldn't have to babysit or worry about.

...on second thought, maybe it's not entirely worry-free: I'd be plenty concerned about the well-being of anything that collides with this monster.

If you're looking for an absolute tank of a power strip (or an armor-piercing flail) and don't foolishly expect it to perform and miracles beyond ""provides six grounded surge-protected sockets while being indestructible"", look no further, Furman's got you.",c,c,5

20,"Daft Punk is one of my all time favorites.  Their 4 singles and video series for them were genius and amazing, but 3 stars was probably generous for this cd because it disappointed me a little.  I'm still confused about whether they are treating this as \\""a new album\\"" since it was so marketed in the US (unlike Alive 1997).  If they are, it was a dissapointment, if it was meant to be a bunch of extended, clublike versions of their previous songs, then it's alright.  Dont get me wrong, the only new songs on the album, Ouverture and Aerodynamite are great and distinct style like Discovery Daft Punk, but the club mixes and experimental songs I could do without.  Parts of the club mixes are great, but they repeat and run on like an average techno song, something I've never known Daft Punk for.  The American influence is clear on this album too with the presence of rap on the Neptunes Remix and Slum Village.  Both songs are terrible and I try to forget that Aerodynamic was destroyed and rap put over it.  I also have to mention that the Romanthony Version of One More Time is possibly the worst song I ever heard, and I'm quite surprised its even on the cd with how bad the singing is.  Artists change, but this wasnt change, it just kinda seemed like they were trying to get you to spend money.  To top it off, I thought I'd finally have access to their website (only people who buy their cds can go there) and when I loaded the cd it took me to a webpage advertising their Interstella 5555 figurines, forcing me to sign up for some advertising scheme for it.  Kinda disappointed but Im trying to tell myself this was just to hold us over for now.",c,d,10

I clean cars all the time as I am a car dealer and the clear suction screen allows you to see if you are still pulling up dirt or if the area is permanently stained and you are just sucking up clean water.

35,although it was hard to assemble I really like it needs some improvement and needs to be able to hold the big giant yarn or one pounder yarn. I couldn't put it together myself I had to have my son in-law do it and he me said it was very cheep but so far I have had no problems I think it is made to cheep but so far I love it and got it really fast. so I am happy with it. If you make a better one already assemble please let me know I would buy another one.,c,c,8

...for how old it is but it is supposed to be extraordinary.  I was willing to pay the price because i love, i mean love, Karen Blixen or Isak Dinesen, whatever name you would like to call her as she had a few.

I wish I could review this film but I cannot as I was sent a foreign version that none of my players can accommodate:(  The company I ordered it from through Amazon ignored my complaints so I finally was wore done enough to just give up.  I guess  I made a donation to them.  I didn't even get a thank you!

However, I do know that Isak wrote a wonderful novel that was turned into the movie Out of Africa (must see!).  One of my all time favorite movies, bar none!

Have faith.  :) I am saving up my recyclables to redeem for cash so I can buy it once again.

At that time I will order, watch, review.  Stay tuned.",b,c,6

44,"I didn't have high expectations, with yet another straight to DVD Western coming along.  The cast of eminently watchable actors (Ed Harris, Jason Isaac) persuaded me though, and Im glad I was.  This is a thoroughly surprising movie, never a pure Western and often pushing genre boundaries.  After a slow start, it really works, thanks in large part to an intermittently witty script and of course the performances.
January Jones plays a woman who endures a tragic loss, which tips her over the edge to drastic action against the source of her tragedy -  the self proclaimed Prophet Josiah, played by Jason Isaacs.  His delusional, dangerous preacher is also responsible for another couple of murders, which brings an eccentric (putting it mildly) sheriff (Ed Harris) to come investigating.  Harris is great value, genuinely unnerving in his eccentricity, skirting the line of cartoonishness while never going over it, and never letting it blunt the characters hard edge.  You feel some sympathy when Isaacs tells him Youre a really queer man, to which the sheriff replies Unusual.  I prefer unusual..  However for me it is Jason Isaacs who steals the show with his portrayal of a character who could easily have been a wafer thin characterization, but becomes fully fleshed out and endlessly watchable in Isaacs hands.  All of these means that the core of the movie  January Jones revenge driven widow, taking matters into her own hands, never quite draws us in as it should  we are more voyeurs to her story than engaged in understanding or debating her motives and actions.
Beyond the characters, the cinematography belies its straight to DVD origins  as it should, with Brad Shield on lensing duties (Moulin Rouge, Star Wars Episode 2, The Avengers).  The scenery in New Mexico is immaculately shot, and the direction by Logan Miller although slow to start, works well in creating a movie with its own distinctive hotch potch of genre styles.
All in all, I liked this  nothing new in the story, but its executed well (no pun intended) and Harris and Isaacs make it a cult classic in my book  not up there with Open Range or Seraphim Falls, but a solid 6/10.
p.s.  this has also been marketed under the title Sweet Vengeance in the UK.",d,d,10
