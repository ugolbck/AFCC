74,"all the publicity controversy identity changing and bizarre personalities aside prince is one of the greatest musicians alive today yet when this phrase is uttered people immediately think that i must admire his ambiguous image and his funny dress-code instead of respecting his musical genius even though i have read as many articles and biographies about him i could find still i do not know him so i am not the one to discuss the real reason behind all the fuss he has been putting out since one thousand , nine hundred and ninety-two not that it matters much since to me the name prince stands for one thing music prince writes music he performs and on this department i absolutely love him simply put no one else i have listened to could flirt across so many genres of music and nail them being incredibly diverse yet so uniquely sounding more than often he surprised me with a song which i initially hated and ended up listening to the most while prince is celebrating his emancipation from major record label it has been increasingly difficult for the casual fans by all mean it does not imply we are any less enthusiastic about his music than the so called diehard fans since we either need to join the music club or having to constantly go on internet and track him down about his latest music venture and more than often realizing that he has changed his mind again call me old-fashioned but i still prefer to go to a music store pay for a well-packaged cd open it and put the cd on while i read the insert as easy downloading music on the computer is i much rather collect a genuine article from an artist on the other hand though i strongly disagree with record label alas film studio interfering with the artistic freedom i do believe the one thing they serve as a certain level of quality control while not saying prince's music released under warner bros are necessarily better they do feel more polished and easier to the ears and those are thesongs that game him the status he has today i do not agree that prince is a washed-out has been as many would claim cynically because i believe this is what prince is aiming for to evolve and mature out of the pop-culture domain what i do agree is if prince continue to change his music releasing scheme strategy he will soon lose more of the even most devoted fans.one reviewer said anyone with half a brain can tell one nite alone ... live is a pretentious album consists of studio overdubs i should really start searching around the house for that half a brain however i do think it would be much better if this box set is titled one nite alone tour collection instead of the misleading word live giving people impression that this is a single live performance other than that the songs that played here are stunning mostly jazzy-funk but there are some true gems on disc two where prince hugs the piano himself playing some of his most beloved hits like adore nothing compares two u and do me baby one of the biggest let down is that according to the accompanying booklet there are plenty more rare and great live performances which are sadly missing here live version of power fantastic is available somewhere but songs like bambi and paisley park where we would have gotten a chance to hear the man himself jamming up the guitar are extremely difficult to find with a box this size three more cds would not be redundant.even though most of the materials here are recycled pasted together from many different sessions of the tour and with the issue of overdubs in question i have to say this is one of the most satisfying listening from prince since a long while ago if you are a jazz funk music fan you will enjoy this if you think the man has lost the touch please stop dwelling on the age of sigh

110,notice do not buy this title w o going through the first one it will make this game way more enjoyable and you will understand the beginning you can consider this title as a 14th century gta tons of stuff to do outside of the main story tons of places to explore same engine used in the cut-scenes is used in the game tons of hidden things insane ways to kill enemies and screw around with the pedestrians they also react very well to your actions the peds improvement over the first title are massive though the xbox version actually runs and looks a hair better than the ps3 version it is still very enjoyable and a full fledged ride of fun and beauty against a gorges score which i think is available on cd i will definitely pick it up very memorable melodies epically that villa one it is technically more difficult to make a transfer of a game onto the ps3 platform for some reason this title on the ps3 has a very light blur glow filter throughout the game it gives it a nice wary warm feeling but it seems to be an attempt to hide other visual issues in the game again the xbox transfer does not have this effect i think still like i said it is really fun pop-in galore the major downfall of this game it is not occasionally it is all the time seems to be more so with vegetation it is very bothersome sometimes like when you are flying through the country side on horseback you see chunks of grass weeds bushes pop-in right in front of you then these pop-ins have a second more detailed layer that overlaps these pop-ins and it is just annoying sometimes this was not common on the previous title this is why i gave a rating of four stars many of the ps3 frame-rate issues from the previous title are fixed in this sequel which is evidence the developers are listening i believe though some horizontal screen splitting is still there when you rotate your camera around ezio on a tall building not too annoying though i was hoping this was fixed because it was in the previous title a-lot everything else is hella fun and amazing great story directly related to the previous game italian renaissance for the first time in games is absolutely beautiful and you feel the atmosphere seriously just simply walking around is entertaining partial spolier :: double-blading an enemy in the eyes makes you quiver and also when you smash in a guys balls while he is on the ground made my jaw drop lol end :: anyways buy it now i will pre-order the final assassins creed title when it comes hope they really take their time on it,3.0,1.0,15,NN VBP RB VB DT NN NN NN VBG IN DT JJ CD PRP MD VB DT NN NN RBR JJ CC PRP MD VB DT NN PRP MD VB DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN NNS IN NN TO VB IN IN DT JJ NN NNS IN NNS TO VB JJ NN VBN IN DT NNS VBZ VBN IN DT NN NNS IN JJ NNS JJ NNS TO VB NNS CC VB RP IN DT NNS PRP RB VBP RB RB TO PRP$ NNS DT NNS NN IN DT JJ NN VBP JJ IN DT NN NN RB VBZ CC VBZ DT NN JJR IN DT NN NN PRP VBZ RB RB JJ CC DT JJ JJ NN IN NN CC NN IN DT NNS VBP WDT FW VBP VBZ JJ IN NN FW MD RB VB PRP RP RB JJ NNS RB IN NN CD PRP VBZ RB RBR JJ TO VB DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NN NN IN DT NN DT NN IN DT NN VBZ DT RB JJ NN NN NN IN DT NN PRP VBZ PRP DT JJ JJ JJ NN CC PRP VBZ TO VB DT NN TO VB JJ JJ NNS IN DT NN RB DT NN NN VBZ RB VB DT NN FW VB RB IN FW VBD PRP VBZ RB NN NN VBP DT JJ NN IN DT NN PRP VBZ RB RB PRP VBZ PDT DT NN VBZ TO VB RBR RB IN NN PRP VBZ RB JJ RB IN WRB PRP VBP VBG IN DT NN NN IN NN PRP VBP NNS IN NN NNS NNS NN NN IN NN IN PRP RB DT NNS VBP DT JJ JJR JJ NN WDT VBZ DT NNS CC PRP VBZ RB JJ RB DT VBD RB JJ IN DT JJ NN DT VBZ WRB FW VBD DT NN IN CD NNS JJ IN DT NN JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN VBP VBN IN DT NN WDT VBZ NN DT NNS VBP VBG FW VBP IN DT JJ NN NN VBZ RB RB WRB PRP VBP PRP$ NN IN NN IN DT JJ NN RB RB JJ IN FW VBD VBG DT VBD VBN IN PRP VBD IN DT JJ NN NN NN RB VBZ JJ NN CC JJ JJ NN RB JJ TO DT JJ NN JJ NN IN DT JJ NN IN NNS VBZ RB JJ CC PRP VBP DT NN RB RB RB VBG RP VBZ JJ JJ NN : : VBG DT NN IN DT NNS VBZ PRP NN CC RB WRB PRP VBP IN DT NNS NNS IN PRP VBZ IN DT NN VBD PRP$ NN NN NN NN : : NNS VBP PRP RB FW MD VB DT JJ NNS NN NN WRB PRP VBZ NN PRP RB VBP PRP$ NN IN PRP,470

155,truly amazing camera i own several dslr cameras with some of the best lenses out there in order to capture all our memories photography is my hobby so i know a thing or two when i see a great shot i needed a small camera to carry with me everywhere so i purchased several but after trying them out they all went back to where they came from until i got my hands on this canon n100 i am very very picky about picture quality so none satisfied this expectation with the exception of this camera i was aware that it is impossible for a small camera to produce professional picture quality but i can safely say this camera bit the odds and took me by surprise it even produces the 3d effect with the blurred background that could only be obtained by dslr cameras with expensive lenses all settings are wonderful on this camera but after using it for almost a year i find myself preferring the auto setting when taking pictures of groups of people because this is the setting that brings everything in the picture into focus and then my most favorite and my mostly used setting is the background defocus this is the one creating the 3d effect with blur the farther the background is from your subject the more blur will be noticed there are two ways to do this once you have selected this setting you can press the shutter or you can touch the screen which is touch sensitive you will not obtain the same result if you touch the screen the spot where the screen has been touched will be the only one truly focused so the rest will be blurred out if you use the shutter button the camera will automatically focus on the face and the rest will be blurred more or less depending how far or close it is from your subject this last one is the best way to create a prof looking picture here are some pictures taken in dark areas without flash ... i used both auto and background defocus settings hope it is been helpful ...,3.0,1.0,10,RB JJ NN FW JJ JJ NN NNS IN DT IN DT JJS NNS IN RB IN NN TO VB DT PRP$ NNS NN VBZ PRP$ NN IN FW VBP DT NN CC CD WRB FW VB DT JJ NN FW VBD DT JJ NN TO VB IN PRP RB RB FW VBD JJ CC IN VBG PRP IN PRP DT VBD RB TO WRB PRP VBD IN IN FW VBD PRP$ NNS IN DT NN NN FW VBP RB RB JJ IN NN NN RB NN JJ DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NN FW VBD JJ IN PRP VBZ JJ IN DT JJ NN TO VB JJ NN NN CC FW MD RB VB DT NN NN DT NNS CC VBD PRP IN NN PRP RB VBZ DT NN NN IN DT VBN NN WDT MD RB VB VBN IN NN NNS IN JJ NNS DT NNS VBP JJ IN DT NN CC IN VBG PRP IN RB DT NN FW VB PRP VBG DT NN NN WRB VBG NNS IN NNS IN NNS IN DT VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ NN IN DT NN IN NN CC RB PRP$ RBS JJ CC PRP$ RB VBN NN VBZ DT NN NN DT VBZ DT CD VBG DT NN NN IN NN DT RBR DT NN VBZ IN PRP$ NN DT JJR NN MD VB VBN EX VBP CD NNS TO VB DT RB PRP VBP VBN DT VBG PRP MD VB DT NN CC PRP MD VB DT NN WDT VBZ NN JJ PRP MD RB VB DT JJ NN IN PRP VBP DT NN DT NN WRB DT NN VBZ VBN VBN MD VB DT JJ CD RB VBN IN DT NN MD VB VBN RP IN PRP VBP DT NN NN DT NN MD RB VB IN DT NN CC DT NN MD VB VBN RBR CC RBR VBG WRB RB CC RB PRP VBZ IN PRP$ NN DT JJ CD VBZ DT JJS NN TO VB DT NN VBG NN RB VBP DT NNS VBN IN JJ NNS IN NN : FW VBN DT NN CC NN NN NNS VBP PRP VBZ VBN JJ :,361

218,my jagged path to ubuntu ... i am not a professional developer nor am i that linux savvy before this distribution i have only had some minor linux experience trying to install off floppy disks which the build could not read my modem so i trashed that idea and went back to windows.flash forward a dozen years my heap of a desktop that was almost as old as my daughter took a dump on me since this was my only means of computing at the time i formatted and reinstalled xp off the disk i had for years i came to realize that it did not have any of the drivers for my ethernet card and i could not get online rather than steal someone else's laptop to burn drivers i figured i would give linux one more shot since it has gotten better over the years i ordered this set with my phone since the price was fair.like the low rated review i thought this was a four dvd install but i am not that disappointed that it is not what you really get is a thirty-two bit dvd sixty-four bit dvd a intro to linux dvd and a library dvd obviously i do not need both install disks but i may use the sixty-four bit on my laptop we just got.my ubuntu review i am currently running it on an old dell with five hundred and twelve mb ram connected to a forty-seven vizio internet tv for a monitor yeah i do weird things like this i wanted a pc to net around with and stream content on my tv the install went very smoothly and ubuntu actually found everything on my computer with no issues mint linux could not find my sound card the programs i use for general stuff were already installed or they could be found on the file network and installed easily enough so everything made the transition easier to linux i am still getting used to the feel but overall it is not a bad alternative i looked through some other distros of linux and found some kde builds that are more like windows but they require ram i do not have in the end ubuntu offered the best environment to use given my resources.if you are new to linux and want to jump in this is a good start i had it up and running in no time and can do just about anything i did with windows visually it is not as pretty as the kde builds like fedora and the feel is like windows 3.1 but it is growing on me.if you are wanting to try different distros you can download them and burn the iso to disk yourself and save money anyone with an average idea on computers can do this.download iso fileburn image to diskboot from cd dvd to install many have a try it feature i would suggest playing around on an old pc first so you do not mess up data and keep you are real one handy just in case you need to reburn or look at info.hope this helps.don t be afraid of change look around and familiarize yourself then step right in,3.0,1.0,8,PRP$ JJ NN TO VB : FW VBP RB DT JJ NN CC VBP FW WDT NN NN IN DT NN FW VBP RB VBD DT JJ NN NN VBG TO VB RP JJ NNS WDT DT VBP MD RB VB PRP$ NN IN FW VBD IN NN CC VBD RB TO JJ RB DT NN NNS PRP$ NN IN DT NN WDT VBD RB IN JJ IN PRP$ NN VBD DT NN IN PRP IN DT VBD PRP$ JJ NNS IN NN IN DT NN FW VBN CC VBN NN IN DT NN FW VBD IN NNS FW VBD TO VB IN PRP VBD RB VB DT IN DT NNS IN PRP$ NN NN CC FW MD RB VB JJ RB IN VB NN RB POS NN TO VB NNS FW VBD FW MD VB NN CD JJR NN IN PRP VBZ VBN RB IN DT NNS FW VBN DT VBN IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN VBD JJ DT JJ VBN NN FW VBD DT VBD DT CD NN VB CC FW VBP RB IN JJ IN PRP VBZ RB WP PRP RB VBP VBZ DT CD NN NN CD NN VBD DT NN TO NN NN CC DT NN NN RB FW VBP RB VB CC VB NNS CC FW MD VB DT CD NN IN PRP$ NN PRP RB JJ NN NN FW VBP RB VBG PRP IN DT JJ NN IN CD CD CC CD NN NN VBN TO DT CD NN NN NN IN DT NN NN FW VBP JJ NNS IN DT FW VBD DT NN TO JJ IN IN CC NN NN IN PRP$ NN DT VB VBD RB RB CC NN RB VBD NN IN PRP$ NN IN DT NNS NN NN MD RB VB PRP$ JJ NN DT NNS FW NN IN JJ NN VBD RB VBN CC PRP MD VB VBN IN DT NN NN CC VBN RB RB RB NN VBD DT NN JJR TO VB FW VBP RB VBG VBN TO DT NN CC JJ PRP VBZ RB DT JJ JJ FW VBD IN DT JJ NNS IN NN CC VBD DT NN VBZ DT VBP RBR IN NNS CC PRP VBP NN FW VBP RB VB IN DT NN NN VBD DT JJS NN TO VB VBN PRP$ NN PRP VBP JJ TO NN CC VBP TO VB IN DT VBZ DT JJ NN FW VBD PRP RP CC VBG IN DT NN CC MD VB RB IN NN FW VBD IN NNS RB PRP VBZ RB IN RB IN DT NN VBZ IN NN CC DT NN VBZ IN NNS CD CC PRP VBZ VBG IN NN PRP VBP VBG TO VB JJ NNS PRP MD VB PRP CC VBP DT NN TO NN PRP CC VB NN NN IN DT JJ NN IN NNS MD VB JJ NN NN NN TO JJ IN NN NN TO VB JJ VBP DT NN PRP VBP FW MD VB VBG IN IN DT JJ NN RB RB PRP VBP RB NN RP NNS CC VB PRP VBP JJ CD JJ RB IN NN PRP VBP TO VB CC VB IN NN DT JJ NN VB JJ IN NN VBP IN CC VB PRP RB VB RB IN,539

252,this bag is durable and inexpensive and protects our car seat during gate check periods whenever we gate check our stroller the bag looks scuffed and dirty but our car seat is completely protected from the elements it is brightly colored so it is easily visible and has a handle to attach gate check tickets and also to carry the car seat in the bag the only draw back is the travel pouch the bag comes in it seems like it will take some effort to try to fit the bag into the pouch it may be easier if the bag can be folded and rolled up with a built in attachment strap to secure it once it is rolled up,3.0,1.0,0,DT NN VBZ JJ CC JJ CC VBZ PRP$ NN NN IN NN NN NNS WRB PRP NN VB PRP$ NN DT NN VBZ JJ CC JJ CC PRP$ NN NN VBZ RB VBN IN DT NNS PRP VBZ RB VBN IN PRP VBZ RB JJ CC VBZ DT VB TO VB NN NN NNS CC RB TO VB DT NN NN IN DT NN DT JJ NN NN VBZ DT NN NN DT NN VBZ IN PRP VBZ IN PRP MD VB DT NN TO VB TO VB DT NN IN DT NN PRP MD VB JJR IN DT NN MD VB VBN CC VBN RP IN DT VBN IN NN NN TO VB PRP IN PRP VBZ VBN RP,121

289,this is an excellent neil young album which is a relief to be able to say because i did not think much of americana his last one this album like americana features crazy horse but is a completely different piece of work and it is terrific in places i think it comes close to his best which makes it something really special.the overall sound and feel is vintage neil young there are the hauntingly melancholy tunes the thoughtful quirky lyrics and the great chord sequences which made albums like harvest and after the goldrush so great combined with the controlled distortion-driven power of the brilliant rust never sleeps am i showing my age here this album is also a reminder of what a great band crazy horse are the sound is terrific there is some great guitar work and they are tight and gutsy so even born in ontario the only slightly weak song on the album still sounds really good.neil young is often meditating on experience and aging here but he still sounds young and fresh and still has more power and guts than a lot of artists half his age several of the tracks are very long driftin back lasts nearly half an hour and other tracks are over fifteen minutes this of course is typical neil young refusing to bow to convention and doing whatever makes musical sense to him at the time he has always done this and it can be dreadful it sometimes has been in the past but nearly all the time here it is great the huge ramada inn is a masterpiece in my view and more conventional shorter tracks like twisted road may well end up in the list of neil young classics.there is little self-indulgence and a huge amount of real musical substance driftin back could perhaps do with a little trimming but it is still a really good track the last half of walk like a giant will probably get the skip-to-next treatment from me but its first eight minutes or so are quite brilliant.you have to hand it to the man he does not mess about and within six months of releasing the mediocre americana he has come up with a real cracker which i think will stand among his finest albums if you are not already familiar with neil young this may not be the best place to start but if you are i suspect that like me you will love this very very warmly recommended t mess about and within six months of releasing the mediocre americana he has come up with a real cracker which i think will stand among his finest albums if you are not already familiar with neil young this may not be the best place to start but if you are i suspect that like me you will love this very very warmly recommended,3.0,1.0,1,DT VBZ DT JJ NN JJ NN WDT VBZ DT NN TO VB JJ TO VB IN FW VBD RB VB JJ IN NN PRP$ JJ CD DT NN IN NN NNS JJ NN CC VBZ DT RB JJ NN IN NN CC PRP VBZ JJ IN NNS FW VBP PRP VBZ RB TO PRP$ JJS WDT VBZ PRP NN RB JJ JJ NN CC NN VBZ JJ NN JJ EX VBP DT RB JJ NNS DT JJ JJ NNS CC DT JJ NN NNS WDT VBD NNS IN NN CC IN DT NN RB JJ VBN IN DT JJ JJ NN IN DT JJ NN RB VBZ RB FW VBG PRP$ NN RB DT NN VBZ RB DT NN IN WP DT JJ NN JJ NN VBP DT NN VBZ JJ EX VBZ DT JJ NN NN CC PRP VBP JJ CC JJ RB RB VBN IN NN DT JJ RB JJ NN IN DT NN RB VBZ RB JJ JJ VBZ RB VBG IN NN CC NN RB CC PRP RB VBZ JJ CC JJ CC RB VBZ JJR NN CC NNS IN DT NN IN NNS PDT PRP$ NN JJ IN DT NNS VBP RB JJ NN RB VBZ RB PDT DT NN CC JJ NNS VBP IN CD NNS DT IN NN VBZ JJ NN JJ VBG TO VB TO NN CC VBG WDT VBZ JJ NN TO PRP IN DT NN PRP VBZ RB VBN DT CC PRP MD VB JJ PRP RB VBZ VBN IN DT NN CC RB PDT DT NN RB PRP VBZ JJ DT JJ JJ NN VBZ DT NN IN PRP$ NN CC JJR JJ JJR NNS IN JJ NN MD RB VB RP IN DT NN IN NN JJ NN VBZ JJ NN CC DT JJ NN IN JJ JJ NN NN RB MD RB VB IN DT JJ VBG CC PRP VBZ RB DT RB JJ NN DT JJ NN IN NN IN DT NN MD RB VB DT NN NN IN PRP CC PRP$ JJ CD NNS CC RB VBP RB JJ VBP TO VB PRP TO DT NN PRP VBZ RB NN RB CC IN CD NNS IN VBG DT JJ NN PRP VBZ VBN RP IN DT JJ NN WDT FW VBP MD VB IN PRP$ JJS NNS IN PRP VBP RB RB JJ IN NN JJ DT MD RB VB DT JJS NN TO VB CC IN PRP VBP FW VBP IN IN PRP PRP MD VB DT RB RB RB VBN NN NN IN CC IN CD NNS IN VBG DT JJ NN PRP VBZ VBN RP IN DT JJ NN WDT FW VBP MD VB IN PRP$ JJS NNS IN PRP VBP RB RB JJ IN NN JJ DT MD RB VB DT JJS NN TO VB CC IN PRP VBP FW VBP IN IN PRP PRP MD VB DT RB RB RB VBN,482

301,i purchased two of the cactus v5 sets to use as a remote flash trigger and remote shutter trigger and after eight months i can say the v5 s are absolutely fantastic i have triggered many thousands of photographs and strobe firings and the cactus v5 s have worked flawlessly each and every time.one of the greatest features is each unit is both transmitter or a receiver selected by the power slide switch on the side slide it one way it transmits slide it the other way it receives if you only buy a pair you will not see this as an advantage but for those of us that use more than two its a huge feature providing tremendous flexibility for example i have four v5 s and have used them in the following configurations one v5 set to transmit on camera hot shoe triggering between 1-3 v5 equipped strobes set to receive i can set each flash to a different channel and by changing channel on the transmitter select any individual strobe or by changing to a group channel i can fire them all.yesterday i was firing a complicated setup one v5 in my hand to transmit two v5 set to receive and plugged in to the camera remote shutter port three v5 on my camera hotshoe mount is set to transmit and has a bounce flash daisy chained on top and finally four v5 is set to receive at my umbrella reflector when i press the button on one half way two focuses the camera when i push one button in all the way two trips the camera shutter the camera hotshoe tells three to fire the bounce flash and the flash connected to four i hope that made sense with any other brand to do what i did in my second scenario i would have needed to buy a second transmitter but with my cactus v5 s i just flipped a switch i am going to buy two more to increase the number of flash units i can fire wirelessly and i am considering buying more after that just to keep on hand as spares i expect to be using my v5 s for many many years,3.0,1.0,13,LS VBD CD IN DT NN NN VBZ TO VB IN DT JJ NN NN CC JJ NN NN CC IN CD NNS FW MD VB DT NN NNS VBP RB JJ FW VBP VBN JJ NNS IN NNS CC NN NNS CC DT NN NN NNS VBP VBN RB DT CC DT NN IN DT JJS NNS VBZ DT NN VBZ CC NN CC DT NN VBN IN DT NN NN NN IN DT NN NN PRP CD NN PRP VBZ NN PRP DT JJ NN PRP VBZ IN PRP RB VBP DT NN PRP MD RB VB DT IN DT NN CC IN DT IN PRP WDT VBP JJR IN CD PRP$ DT JJ NN VBG JJ NN IN NN FW VBP CD NN NNS CC VBP VBN PRP IN DT VBG NNS CD NN VBN TO VB IN NN JJ NN NN IN CD NN VBN NNS VBD TO VB FW MD VB DT NN TO DT JJ NN CC IN VBG NN IN DT NN JJ DT JJ NN CC IN VBG TO DT NN NN FW MD VB PRP JJ FW VBD NN DT JJ NN CD NN IN PRP$ NN TO VB CD NN VBN TO VB CC VBN IN TO DT NN JJ NN NN CD NN IN PRP$ NN NN VBP VBZ VBN TO VB CC VBZ DT NN NN NN JJ IN JJ CC RB CD NN VBZ VBN TO VB IN PRP$ NN NN WRB FW NN DT NN IN CD DT NN CD VBZ DT NN WRB FW NN CD NN IN PDT DT NN CD NNS DT NN VBD DT NN NN VBZ CD TO VB DT NN NN CC DT NN VBN TO CD FW VBP IN VBN NN IN DT JJ NN TO VB WP FW VBD IN PRP$ JJ NN FW MD VB VBN TO VB DT JJ NN CC IN PRP$ NN NN VBZ FW RB VBD DT NN FW VBP VBG TO VB CD JJR TO VB DT NN IN NN NNS FW MD VB RB CC FW VBP VBG VBG JJR IN DT RB TO VB IN NN IN NNS FW VBP TO VB VBG PRP$ NN NNS IN JJ JJ NNS,370

428,i am rather ashamed to admit that though i have always respected her obvious musical talent from afar i would somehow managed to escape fiona's charms all these years ... until the other night when i could not resist any longer after being intrigued enough by the samples i would heard here and on her myspace page i purchased the idler wheel ... that same night and proceeded to listen to it three times straight through the first time i was bewildered by what i was hearing as it was difficult for me to connect with in the same way it is difficult for me to connect with the avant-garde jazz of john coltrane or thelonious monk even though i could definitely appreciate the artistry involved in the music's construction the second time it all made a little more sense but i still was not totally feeling it toward the end of my third listen however i realized my cheeks were starting to hurt i would been smiling from ear to ear for about a good thirty minutes straight.this is an album that works so perfectly as a whole work of art it is hard for me to cite specific highlights most of the songs are dependent on the ebbs and flows of what came before to have its maximum effect so i definitely recommend listening to this album straight through a few times or at least in large chunks before deciding this is not your thing like some fans are saying as a fan of more guitar-driven rock it is not really my thing either or so i thought then i just put my headphones on let go of all my preconceived notions of what it should sound like and let fiona bring me into her world a world that to me is almost like some weird parallel-dimension 1940s in which she is the billie holiday of that reality only one who plays a mean piano with odd time-signatures curlicue melodies household object-based percussion and insanely varied vocals and lyrics that make you feel her wide spectrum of emotions even if you do not quite fully understand them.fiona can go from singing about love to anger to sorrow to despair to paranoia to neon zebras within the span of a couple songs and the result is intoxicating if you just give in to it and let her take you there her voice ranges from angelic to maniacal and everything in between sometimes all within the same song leaving me feeling almost exhausted at times but by the time i get to the excellent kaleidoscopic and insane hot knife which closes the album i am usually ready to take another ride the production on the album is very sparse with rarely more than piano and percussion framing fiona's voice but that only helps magnify the range and authenticity of emotion coming out of her and the result is as close to perfection as i am likely to hear this year or any year the idler wheel ... is not always an easy fun ride but i can almost guarantee that if you let it it will be a fulfilling one there is no higher compliment i can give than that it is not impenetrable some works of art are just deeper and take longer to sink in and those are the ones that tend to stick with you longer and affect you more profoundly this album will one day be considered a masterpiece i am sure but i am just thankful to have finally discovered her beautiful work even if i am about a decade and a half late hopefully she does not take another seven years to resurface next time though thankfully i will have a few new-to-me old albums of hers to tide me over in the meantime and i am sure that if her next album is anywhere near as brilliant and inspiring as this one the wait will definitely have been worth it the live dvd included with the deluxe version is very high-quality and well worth spending the extra cash for as fiona is in top form at least as far as i can tell considering i am a fiona apple

431,i purchased this game in clearance at target after playing ultimate destruction for the gamecube and loving it might i add i had high expectations that this game would be very similar but with next gen graphics etc but boy was i wrong.this game is not even sort of bad it is absolutely awful first off the thing i loved about ultimate destruction was the diversity of combat and unlockable moves and the ability to combine sweet combos to make massive destruction hence the name on your enemies the combat in this game does not even come close remember those awesome moves like turning a bus into a surf board or running up the face of a skyscraper and pile driving off of it into the ground below forget it you will not find any of that here except for clunky tedious what feels like broken and unfinished combat i could go on forever about how much of an absolute garbage pile this game is but lets move on to the story and missions.now in all fairness ultimate destruction was not perfect but man was it a blast you actually felt like you had the power of the hulk at your finger tips i enjoyed the story a lot as well it felt like it was coming straight from one of the comic books sure a couple of the missions were a bit blah but even the worst missions in ultimate destruction look like flawless pieces of art compared to the garbage in this game.it s difficult for me to even comprehend in my mind and interpret it accurately in words that is how awful the gameplay story is in this game to better make you understand i actually forced myself to try and finish this game and i could not bring myself to do it it feels written scripted by a two year old the missions are so bland go here or go beat up those guys that you want to stick a magnum and blow your head off now to defend my statement many games have those sort of tedious missions which i would not have minded but add tedious missions onto god-awful gameplay mechanics that make you want to drill your eyeballs out and you got yourself a jolly good time.my only question is how how does a game where you get to play as the freaking hulk turn out so bad i have no idea ... all they would have had to do is copy ultimate destruction with hd graphics and i would have been the happiest person alive.heed my warning or ignore it but i pity the fool who pays ninety dollars for this game i cannot even believe this putrid pile of poop is even selling this high as for me i am going to pull out my gamecube and play ultimate destruction again i advise you ro so the same,0.0,0.0,2,FW VBN DT NN IN NN IN NN IN VBG JJ NN IN DT NN CC JJ PRP MD FW VB FW VBD JJ NNS IN DT NN MD VB RB JJ CC IN JJ NN NNS NN CC NN VBD FW FW NN VBZ RB RB NN IN JJ PRP VBZ RB JJ RB IN DT NN FW VBD IN JJ NN VBD DT NN IN NN CC JJ NNS CC DT NN TO VB JJ NNS TO VB JJ NN RB DT NN IN PRP$ NNS DT NN IN DT NN VBZ RB RB VB RB VB DT JJ NNS IN VBG DT NN IN DT NN NN CC VBG RP DT NN IN DT NN CC NN VBG IN IN PRP IN DT NN IN VB PRP PRP MD RB VB DT IN DT RB IN IN JJ JJ WP VBZ IN JJ CC JJ NN FW MD VB IN RB IN WRB JJ IN DT JJ NN NN DT NN VBZ CC VBZ NN IN TO DT NN CC NN IN DT NN JJ NN VBD RB JJ CC NN VBD PRP DT NN PRP RB VBD IN PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN NNS FW VBD DT NN DT NN RB RB PRP VBD IN PRP VBD VBG RB IN CD IN DT JJ NNS RB DT NN IN DT NNS VBD DT NN JJ CC RB DT JJS NNS IN JJ NN NN IN JJ NNS IN NN VBN TO DT NN IN DT NN VBZ JJ IN PRP TO RB VB IN PRP$ NN CC VB PRP RB IN NNS WDT VBZ WRB JJ DT NN NN VBZ IN DT NN TO JJR VB PRP VB FW RB VBN PRP TO VB CC VB DT NN CC FW MD RB VB PRP TO VB PRP PRP VBZ VBN VBN IN DT CD NN JJ DT NNS VBP RB JJ VBP RB CC VB VB RP DT NNS IN PRP VBP TO VB DT NN CC VB PRP$ NN IN RB TO VB PRP$ NN JJ NNS VBP DT NN IN JJ NNS WDT FW MD RB VB VBN CC VBP JJ NNS IN JJ NN NNS WDT VBP PRP VB TO VB PRP$ NNS IN CC PRP VBD PRP DT RB JJ NN RB NN VBZ WRB WRB VBZ DT NN WRB PRP VBP TO VB IN DT VBG NN VB RP RB JJ FW VBP DT NN : DT PRP MD VB VBN TO VB VBZ NN JJ NN IN NN NNS CC FW MD VB VBN DT JJS NN VBD PRP$ NN CC VB PRP CC FW NN DT NN WP VBZ CD NNS IN DT NN FW MD RB RB VB DT JJ NN IN NN VBZ RB VBG DT JJ IN IN PRP FW VBP VBG TO VB RP PRP$ NN CC VB JJ NN RB FW VBP PRP FW IN DT JJ,487

445,"cyril scott 1879-1970 had the misfortune of too easy success early in his career and mounting neglect for the rest of his life from as early as one thousand , nine hundred and thirty he was being written off as an imitator of debussy who had nothing more worth saying does this adventurous cd confirm or refute this view though a lifelong lover of his music i have to confess that the muses scott's first mature symphony is like the curate's egg good in parts but unacceptable as a whole it starts well with a sinister and brooding opening movement but the middle movements are underdeveloped and the choral finale is a watered down version of the general dance at the end of ravel's daphnis and chloe the second piano concerto of one thousand , nine hundred and fifty-eight is representative of the far more individual idiom that scott developed when he returned to composing in the late 1940s the harmony has an acrid complexity the phrases are brief and there is none of the effortless note-spinning that led colin matthews to dismiss his earlier music as vapid unfortunately the work never establishes a convincing relationship between the soloist and the orchestra and is full of striking gestures that lead nowhere the recently recorded second string quartet played by archaeus quartet on the dutton label is a far more attractive example of his late style that leaves neptune which is a revised version of disaster at sea a long tone poem depicting the sinking of the titanic that was written in the late 1910s there was a tardy first performance in one thousand , nine hundred and thirty-three when the critics panned the work as mere film music scott responded by removing the more crudely programmatic parts of the score in a revised and renamed version of the work which was published in one thousand , nine hundred and thirty-five but has gone unperformed till now i am happy to hail it as a masterpiece the tragic atmosphere is sustained throughout and the writing is beautifully diaphanous and full of highly original orchestral effects which evoke the surge and the spray and the careering bulk of the doomed ship with uncanny vividness there is nothing finer in scott than the bleak epilogue depicting the bare and icy ocean as night sets in in the wake of the famous film and with the original title restored could not this work achieve a belated popularity certainly this skilfully crafted and richly sonorous recording makes the strongest possible case it and the neapolitan rhapsody available on a marco polo cd seem to me the two strongest works by scott for orchestra alone",3.0,1.0,2,"NN NN CD VBD DT NN IN RB JJ NN RB IN PRP$ NN CC VBG NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN IN RB JJ IN CD CD , CD CD CC CD PRP VBD VBG VBN RP IN DT NN IN NN WP VBD NN JJR JJ VBG VBZ DT JJ NN VBP CC VBP DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN FW VBP TO VB IN DT NNS VBP POS JJ JJ NN VBZ IN DT NN POS NN NN IN NNS CC JJ IN DT JJ PRP VBZ RB IN DT JJ CC JJ NN NN CC DT JJ NNS VBP JJ CC DT JJ NN VBZ DT VBN RP NN IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN NN POS NN CC VBP DT JJ NN NN IN CD CD , CD CD CC CD VBZ NN IN DT RB RBR JJ NN WDT VBP VBN WRB PRP VBD TO VBG IN DT JJ CD DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN DT NNS VBP JJ CC EX VBZ NN IN DT JJ JJ WDT VBD NN NNS TO VB PRP$ JJR NN IN JJ RB DT NN RB VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT NN CC DT NN CC VBZ JJ IN JJ NNS WDT VBP RB DT RB VBN JJ NN NN VBN IN NN NN IN DT NN NN VBZ DT RB RBR JJ NN IN PRP$ JJ NN WDT VBZ NN WDT VBZ DT VBN NN IN NN IN NN DT JJ NN NN VBG DT NN IN DT JJ DT VBD VBN IN DT JJ CD EX VBD DT JJ JJ NN IN CD CD , CD CD CC CD WRB DT NNS VBD DT NN IN JJ NN NN NN VBD IN VBG DT RBR RB JJ NNS IN DT NN IN DT VBN CC VBN NN IN DT NN WDT VBD VBN IN CD CD , CD CD CC CD CC VBZ VBN JJ IN RB FW VBP JJ TO VB PRP IN DT NN DT JJ NN VBZ VBN IN CC DT NN VBZ RB JJ CC JJ IN RB JJ JJ NNS WDT VBP DT NN CC DT NN CC DT VBG NN IN DT JJ NN IN JJ NN EX VBZ NN NN IN NN IN DT JJ NN VBG DT JJ CC NN NN IN NN NNS IN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN CC IN DT JJ NN VBD MD RB DT NN VB DT JJ NN RB DT RB VBN CC RB JJ NN VBZ DT JJS JJ NN PRP CC DT NN NN JJ IN DT NN NN NN VBP TO PRP DT CD JJS NNS IN NN IN NN RB",449

535,i was a bit skeptical about buying an aftermarket battery grip for my new canon eos rebel t2i 550d in other parts of the world but since using it i have nothing but good things to say about this part i recently took a short vacation to mt rushmore in the black hills of south dakota and had this grip installed for the entire three day trip i took hundreds of photos and a lot of video note also that i am not an old-school photographer that likes to use the viewfinder but rather prefer to use live view screen mode which eats the batteries much more quickly the batteries that came with the grip lasted for the first two days before running low i had another set and was able to keep on shooting i also like the included aa battery tray which gives you the option of powering the camera with six aa batteries which could be a real life saver in a pinch i would rate the feel fit finish and quality of this part to be on par with the camera itself the plastic and grip are nearly identical to the camera the controls function perfectly and make portrait position photos more comfortable than i have ever experienced i have large hands and the comfort factor is the biggest reason that i purchased this to begin with as the normal landscape position is more comfortable as well anyone who has picked up the t2i 550d knows instantly that it is not a heavy camera and actually is a bit on the lightweight side this grip with two batteries actually improves the balance by adding heft and size which can create a much better user experience the only thing i would caution is to consider buying the package with four batteries to allow for change-outs if you do not already have spares that said i highly recommend this product over the one hundred and seventy oem grip from canon which does not include extra batteries and even if you do not have the spare batteries you can get by on aas if you need to update 11/10 two thousand and ten i have now been using this battery grip for about four months and still have nothing but good things to say the rubberized grip has held up well with no noticeable signs of wear the battery life has not seemed to have diminished with time and use there have been some negative comments by other users but i still stand by my original comments update 4/12 two thousand and eleven this part has continued to hold up well the only thing i have noticed is that the printing on the grip by the buttons has worn somewhat as opposed to the printing on the camera itself which has held up with no noticeable wear clearly the manufacturing process at meike is not up to the same level as it is at canon that said i have enjoyed flawless performance from this part and it has not left my camera since i received it the batteries have held up equally well,3.0,1.0,6,LS VBD DT NN JJ IN VBG DT NN NN NN IN PRP$ JJ NN NNS VBP JJ NN IN JJ NNS IN DT NN CC IN VBG PRP FW VBP NN CC JJ NNS TO VB IN DT NN FW RB VBD DT JJ NN TO VB NN IN DT JJ NNS IN JJ NNP CC VBD DT NN VBN IN DT JJ CD NN NN FW VBD NNS IN NNS CC DT NN IN NN NN RB IN FW VBP RB DT JJ NNP WDT VBZ TO VB DT NN CC RB VBP TO VB JJ NN NN NN WDT VBZ DT NNS RB RBR RB DT NNS WDT VBD IN DT NN VBD IN DT JJ CD NNS IN VBG JJ FW VBD DT NN CC VBD JJ TO VB IN NN FW RB IN DT VBN NN NN NN WDT VBZ PRP DT NN IN VBG DT NN IN CD NN NNS WDT MD VB DT JJ NN NN IN DT NN FW MD VB DT NN JJ NN CC NN IN DT NN TO VB IN NN IN DT NN PRP DT NN CC NN VBP RB JJ TO DT NN DT NNS VBP RB CC VB NN NN NNS RBR JJ IN FW VBP RB JJ FW VBP JJ NNS CC DT NN NN VBZ DT JJS NN WDT FW VBN DT TO VB IN IN DT JJ NN NN VBZ RBR JJ RB RB NN WP VBZ VBN RP DT NN NN VBZ RB IN PRP VBZ RB DT JJ NN CC RB VBZ DT NN IN DT JJ NN DT NN IN CD NNS RB VBZ DT NN IN VBG NN CC NN WDT MD VB DT RB JJR NN NN DT JJ NN FW MD VB VBZ TO VB VBG DT NN IN CD NNS TO VB IN NNS IN PRP VBP RB RB VB NNS WDT VBD FW RB VB DT NN IN DT CD CD CC CD NN NN IN NN WDT VBZ RB VB JJ NNS CC RB IN PRP VBP RB VB DT JJ NNS PRP MD VB IN IN NNS IN PRP VBP TO VB CD CD CD CC CD FW VBP RB VBN VBG DT NN NN IN IN CD NNS CC RB VBP NN CC JJ NNS TO VB DT JJ NN VBZ VBN RP RB IN DT JJ NNS IN NN DT NN NN VBZ RB VBN TO VB VBN IN NN CC NN EX VBP VBN DT JJ NNS IN JJ NNS CC FW RB VB IN PRP$ JJ NNS VBP CD CD CD CC NNS DT NN VBZ VBN TO VB RP RB DT JJ NN FW VBP VBN VBZ IN DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NNS VBZ VBN RB IN VBN TO DT NN IN DT NN PRP WDT VBZ VBN RP IN DT JJ NN RB DT NN NN IN NN VBZ RB RB TO DT JJ NN IN PRP VBZ IN NN WDT VBD FW VBP VBN JJ NN IN DT NN CC PRP VBZ RB VBN PRP$ NN IN FW VBD PRP DT NNS VBP VBN RP RB RB,524

544,well i like small portable flashes i have gone through a few sunpak one hundred and twenty-one s they are really cheap so i do not mind and contemplated a leica sf or contax tla two hundred flash which both use awkward batteries eventually this fuji flash came out promising to be compact with good build quality and manual controls i found one slightly used on ebay i have a x100 though my primary camera is a mamiya seven medium format film camera.pros awesome build quality seems to match the x-pro one and certainly does fine on my x100 takes aaas ... not quite as convenient as aas but still a lot better than those crazy batteries that other similar flashes take ttl metering on the fuji cameras is quite good though i use it mostly on manual controlling the flash is a breeze for this i would give it five stars really excellent and easy to switch between manual and ttl it works really conveniently as an off-camera flash triggered by your camera's built-in flash i love this feature my old nikon dslr had it and i cannot wait to use it more with the fuji although i suppose with a hotshoe extension cord you could retain ttl like the nikon somehow had comes with a leather case and a little tripod adapter as it should for over two hundred both nicely made it locks into the fujis with a little button release ... very nice feature it seems to still mount on all other cameras though it will not lock into the hotshoe.cons like most of the x100 s controls the exposure dial on the ef-x twenty is very loose and prone to being moved accidentally it is a little bit too big for the x100 from the photos i have seen it looks pretty balanced on the x-pro one and it feels like nothing on my mamiya seven but on the x100 it is a little heavy compared to the camera the auto-startup and shutdown when you turn off the camera the flash turns off too okay cool but if the camera is on and the flash is off and you try to turn the flash on itwill start up for about a quarter of a second and then just go back off after six or seven times of this it will finally stay on if the flash is already on and then you turn on the camera the flash will go off i am not sure if my unit is defective but that is pretty annoying i discovered that if you turn them both on at the same time they work.overall this flash functions pretty well on the fuji cameras once you get it turned on i really wish this flash had an auto setting with a mini exposure chart on the back like the sunpaks do they can be used with any camera really easily i guess if you only shoot digital manual mode is a fine alternative i use it plenty on film too is it the perfect flash for any camera it is just okay for that it is really small and portable much stronger and higher up than the x100 s flash and would make a good addition to any kit i use flash a lot and this one is probably the best option for the x100 and x-pro one unless you need to be bouncing light,3.0,1.0,14,RB FW IN JJ JJ NNS FW VBP VBN IN DT JJ NN CD CD CC CD NNS PRP VBP RB JJ IN FW VBP RB VB CC VBD DT NN NN CC NN NN CD CD NN WDT DT VBP JJ NNS RB DT NN NN VBD RP JJ TO VB JJ IN JJ VBP NN CC JJ NNS FW VBD CD RB VBN IN NN FW VBP DT NN IN PRP$ JJ NN VBZ DT NN CD NN NN NN NNS JJ VB NN VBZ TO VB DT NN CD CC RB VBZ NN IN PRP$ NN VBZ NNS : RB RB IN JJ IN NNS CC RB DT NN JJR IN DT JJ NNS IN JJ JJ NNS VBP NN NN IN DT NN NNS VBZ RB JJ IN FW VBP PRP RB IN NN VBG DT NN VBZ DT NN IN DT FW MD VB PRP CD NNS RB JJ CC JJ TO VB IN NN CC NN PRP VBZ RB RB IN DT JJ NN VBN IN PRP$ NN POS JJ NN FW VBP DT NN PRP$ JJ NN NN VBD PRP CC FW MD RB VB TO VB PRP RBR IN DT NN IN FW VB IN DT NN NN NN PRP MD VB NN IN DT NN RB VBD VBZ IN DT NN NN CC DT JJ NN NN IN PRP MD IN IN CD CD DT RB VBN PRP VBZ IN DT NNS IN DT JJ NN NN : RB JJ NN PRP VBZ TO RB VB IN DT JJ NNS IN PRP MD RB VB IN DT NNS IN JJS IN DT NN VBZ VBZ DT NN NN IN DT JJ CD VBZ RB JJ CC JJ TO VBG VBN RB PRP VBZ DT JJ NN RB JJ IN DT NN IN DT NNS FW VBP VBN PRP VBZ RB VBN IN DT NN CD CC PRP VBZ IN NN IN PRP$ NN CD CC IN DT CD PRP VBZ DT JJ JJ VBN TO DT NN DT NN CC NN WRB PRP VBP RP DT NN DT NN VBZ RP RB JJ NN CC IN DT NN VBZ IN CC DT NN VBZ RB CC PRP VBP TO VB DT NN IN NN VB RP IN IN DT NN IN DT JJ CC RB RB VB RB RB IN CD CC CD NNS IN DT PRP MD RB VB IN IN DT NN VBZ RB IN CC RB PRP VB RP DT NN DT NN MD VB RP FW VBP RB JJ IN PRP$ NN VBZ JJ CC DT VBZ RB JJ FW VBN IN IN PRP VBP PRP DT RP IN DT JJ NN PRP VBP DT NN VBZ RB RB IN DT NN NNS RB PRP VB PRP VBD RP FW RB VB DT NN VBD DT NN NN IN DT JJ NN NN IN DT NN IN DT NNS VBP PRP MD VB VBN IN DT NN RB RB FW NN IN PRP RB VBP JJ NN NN VBZ DT JJ NN FW VB PRP RB IN NN RB VBZ PRP DT JJ NN IN DT NN PRP VBZ RB JJ IN IN PRP VBZ RB JJ CC JJ RB JJR CC JJR IN IN DT NN VBZ NN CC MD VB DT JJ NN TO DT NN FW NN VBP DT NN CC DT CD VBZ RB DT JJS NN IN DT NN CC NN CD IN PRP VBP TO VB VBG NN,575

569,i preordered this with my om-d em5 kit on amazon the second it was released february seven two thousand and twelve while the om-d is still nowhere to be seen no big deal i guess it is been only seventy-one days of wait after all the mmf three arrived last week and i unpacked it last night.first thing first all 4/3 to m43 adapters are mechanically the same there is no chip no electronics there are only pass-through electrical contacts the long story some mmf history you can skip to the end if you do not feel like reading the whole thing ): the mmf one came first it came at the time when there were almost no m43 lenses available and when a m43 user had to rely on his her 4/3 lens collection it was also the time when olympus was still expecting to be able to solve in a fast way the issue with m43 cameras being slow to focus with 4/3 lenses i am not inventing this af part it is all in the interviews with olympus techs popping up here and there throughout the years they really did not expect it to be that difficult the mmf one was awfully expensive for what it was but at least had this beautiful metal construction which sweetened the pill a bit then came the mmf two this was an adapter first released in a kit with the 4/3 40-150 mm lens it was a great deal as basically one of the items whichever side you look at it ended up being free given that the kit was at a mild one hundred and ninety-nine msrp.the mmf two was even more awfully expensive than the mmf one it weighed half the weight of the mmf one not a bad thing in itself but it had a flimsy plasticky construction to not help things once the mmf two 40-150 mm kit was discontinued that is once the m43 version of the 40-150 mm was released the price of the mmf two alone went to a whopping one hundred and ninety-nine msrp one hundred and fifty street price for what is basically a piece of plastic.to its defense by the time the mmf two was released olympus had already realized that making regular non cdaf optimized lenses focus fast on a m43 camera will not be that easy especially the swd lenses gee by that time they actually had problems with slow af on their main camera lens m43 combos problem which was only solved months down the line with firmware updates.it was by then clear that the 4/3 lenses in use with the m43 cameras will be only the cdaf optimized ones which all weigh close to nothing anyway so it was fine.enter the om-d em5 camera.this one is the hot one in oly's m43 lineup it is the first m43 camera body to be weather sealed to olympus credit they also released the mmf three adapter with it the mmf three is weather sealed and this is where it becomes interesting the weather sealed 4/3 lenses are for the most big and heavy well not all but most of the really interesting ones anyway so one would expect this adapter to have at least the mmf one s metal construction and solid feel.alas it was not to be the mmf three is a flimsy plasticky thing just as flimsy as the mmf two the mmf one construction is nowhere to be found it is basically an mmf two with an o-ring on the male side which is proof that this thing is expected to be used only with the 14-54 mm mk2 the only oly 4/3 lens to be weather sealed and cdaf optimized and which is not very heavy i know i know one should always handle a lens camera combo by its heaviest part meaning you are not supposed to carry your 35-100 mm zuiko with a panasonic gf three on it by the camera body of course not.still a heavy lens can put strain on the adapter when shifting in a bag you can in the heat of the moment shift weight between your arms and have a few seconds when the load goes on the camera body side you can ... stuff happens i would prefer a strong adapter vs a weak one any time i am not saying it will break on the spot i just do not feel secure using this thing with a heavy and expensive lens.the one that still laughs at all this the panasonic dmw-ma one lumix g 4/3 dslr mount adapter this baby is still selling is still a panasonic branded mmf one and still costs one hundred and fourteen the short story all 4/3 to m43 adapters function the same there are no electronics there just electrics the olympus mmf one expensive and the the panasonic dmw-ma one the least expensive of all brand name adapters have solid metal construction the olympus mmf two has flimsy plastic construction the new olympus mmf three is a weather sealed mmf two not a weather sealed mmf one there is a chinese alternative the jjc something which is even less expensive than the the panasonic dmw-ma one and is said to be a copy of the mmf one not of the mmf two the jury is still out as of whether the mmf two is actually flimsy enough to cause concern as with everything olympus it is up to specs and does what it is intended to do it is just that it has that flimsy feel and look update just stumbled on this description on the global olympus website released february eight two thousand and twelve :\ four thirds mount adapter mmf 3this adapter has the same function as the mmf one and mmf two adapters designed for use in mounting a four thirds lens on a micro four thirds camera body the mmf three features the same dust splash-proof construction as the camera when one of the twelve dust splash-proof zuiko digital lenses of the shg super high grade or hg high grade series is mounted on the olympus om-d by means of the mmf three pictures with incomparably high image quality can be manifested even under severe environments.the adapter has a detachable tripod mount so safe operation is possible even when a large-aperture lens is used love the detachable tripod mount part something definitely got lost along the way didn'tit :d enjoy this announcement while it lasts i

603,funnily enough i started listening to this album before i even reached adolescence after expressing to my parents an interest in dion and the belmonts most of the time i would just listen and laugh at some songs silly or over-serious treatment of otherwise serious occasions love potion nine always tickled my funny bone as did who is that lady and especially bang bang other songs were heavier ike and tina's two-faced proud mary and the glory of love which always seems to linger to dwell in my ears in a way similar to fats domino's slow and penetrating croon and somehow walk do not run alone managed to instill in me the ability to see beauty and fun in a song that does not have well-known choruses to carry it through.not all twenty-four of these sweet songs are really legendary in style presentation and content they did not cause shifts in musical paradigms or provoke deep contemplation there is nothing here that you will not be able to hear on your local oldies station if you wait around long enough but to dismiss this stuff because of its relative simplicity would be too hasty a move for lovers of sound.this is a great album when you are in the mood for the kind of sounds produced before rubber soul blew brian wilson's mind and yes a little bit after as well ): lightweight simple often though not entirely upbeat ... i have found that it is good to unwind to and it never fails to provide the same laughs and smiles as when i was a kid all the way from eddie cochran's visit to his local congressman to cher falling off her imaginary horse to the highwaymen's perfect quieting closing.in the words of jan and dean it is not very cherry it is an oldie but a goody ...,3.0,1.0,0,RB RB FW VBD VBG TO DT NN IN FW RB VBN NN IN VBG TO PRP$ NNS DT NN IN NN CC DT NNS JJS IN DT NN FW MD RB VB CC NN IN DT NNS JJ CC JJ NN IN RB JJ NNS VBP NN CD RB VBD PRP$ JJ NN IN VBD WP VBZ IN NN CC RB NN NN JJ NNS VBD JJR NN CC NN POS JJ JJ NN CC DT NN IN NN WDT RB VBZ TO VB TO VB IN PRP$ NNS IN DT NN JJ TO NNS NN POS JJ CC VBG NN CC RB VBP VBP RB VB RB VBN TO VB IN PRP DT NN TO VB NN CC NN IN DT NN WDT VBZ RB VB JJ NNS TO VB PRP IN DT CD IN DT JJ NNS VBP RB JJ IN NN NN CC NN PRP VBD RB VB NNS IN JJ NNS CC VB JJ NN EX VBZ NN RB IN PRP MD RB VB JJ TO VB IN PRP$ JJ NNS NN IN PRP VBP RB RB RB CC TO VB DT NN IN IN PRP$ JJ NN MD VB RB JJ DT NN IN NNS IN NN VBZ DT JJ NN WRB PRP VBP IN DT NN IN DT NN IN NNS VBN IN NN NN VBD JJ NN POS NN CC RB DT JJ NN IN RB RB -RRB- : JJ JJ RB IN RB RB JJ : FW VBP VBN IN PRP VBZ JJ TO VB TO CC PRP RB VBZ TO VB DT JJ NNS CC VBZ IN WRB FW VBD DT NN PDT DT NN IN NN NN POS NN TO PRP$ JJ NN TO NN VBG RP PRP$ JJ NN TO DT NNS POS JJ VBG NN DT NNS IN NN CC NN PRP VBZ RB RB JJ PRP VBZ DT NN CC DT NN :,311

648,i have used tax cut in the past and have been satisfied but i read about download install issues with tax cut this year and decided to try turbo tax i found turbo tax to be very rigid for example my wife donates to twenty-five thirty different charities each year with tax cut they just required the name of the charity and amount turbo tax requires an address for every charity if i left the address off tt would not allow that donation to be added now i have the cancelled checks for all these charities but i had to look up every address on the net in order to enter these deductions into turbo another example is that my wife has a sar sep for her business that retirement plan allows a catch-up deduction which the standard sep plan does not allow turbo does not provide a sar sep option and would not allow me to enter a catch-up deduction to the sep calculation tax cut does not support a sar sep either but tax cut gives the option to enter the deduction amount for sar sep that you self-calculate so these are two examples where i had to go through extraordinary efforts to work through turbo's rigidity they seem to think that if turbo does not support it you do not need it at least allow me to add or over-ride at my own risk there were others that i will not go into here i also was disappointed with intuit's itsdeductible web site this site is advertised as a place to enter your charitable deductions for non-cash deductions it provides estimates of donated item's value again it would not allow me to over-ride a value if i knew my item had a higher value i had no option to change it so i figured i could export the data to a spreadsheet and make modifications wrong again there were questions on the site asking how the information could be downloaded but no answers intuit wants to lock up your data so you cannot get away.tax cut also does the job with what seems to be less rigidity i will probably go back to tax cut next year,3.0,1.0,11,LS VBP VBN NN NN IN DT NN CC VBP VBN JJ CC FW VBN IN NN VB NNS IN NN NN DT NN CC VBD TO VB NN NN FW VBN NN NN TO VB RB JJ IN NN PRP$ NN VBZ TO CD CD JJ NNS DT NN IN NN NN PRP RB VBD DT NN IN DT NN CC NN NN NN VBZ DT NN IN DT NN IN FW VBD DT NN IN NN MD RB VB DT NN TO VB VBN RB FW VBP DT VBN NNS IN PDT DT NNS CC FW VBD TO VB RP DT NN IN DT NN IN NN TO VB DT NNS IN NN DT NN VBZ IN PRP$ NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN IN NN NN VBZ DT NN NN WDT DT JJ NN NN VBZ RB VB NN VBZ RB VB DT NN NN NN CC MD RB VB PRP TO VB DT NN NN TO DT NN NN NN NN VBZ RB VB DT NN NN CC CC NN NN VBZ DT NN TO VB DT NN NN IN JJ NN IN PRP VBP RB DT VBP CD NNS WRB FW VBD TO VB IN JJ NNS TO VB IN NN POS NN PRP VBP TO VB IN IN NN VBZ RB VB PRP PRP VBP RB VB PRP IN JJS VB PRP TO VB CC VB IN PRP$ JJ NN EX VBD NNS WDT FW MD RB VB IN RB FW RB VBD VBN IN NN POS JJ NN NN DT NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN TO VB PRP$ JJ NNS IN JJ NNS PRP VBZ NNS IN VBN NN POS NN RB PRP MD RB VB PRP TO VB DT NN IN FW VBD PRP$ NN VBD DT JJR NN FW VBD DT NN TO VB PRP RB FW VBD FW MD VB DT NNS TO DT NN CC VB NNS JJ RB EX VBD NNS IN DT NN VBG WRB DT NN MD VB VBN CC DT NNS NN VBZ TO VB RP PRP$ NNS IN PRP MD RB VB JJ NN RB VBZ DT NN IN WP VBZ TO VB JJR NN FW MD RB VB RB TO NN NN JJ NN,370

697,i absolutely love this tripod mount ... and here is why if you have not done so i would highly recommend googling fstoppers iphone fashion shoot it was basically a shoot done to prove that it is not the camera but the photographer that creates beautiful images that shoot was my inspiration for buying this accessory but in the real world sometimes when doing portrait work pre-shoot prep i do not want to have to take out my camera the thing is heavy shoot download from memory card and then sort through it is much easier to whip out my iphone and snap a couple of shots show them to my assistant or text them to someone i decided i needed a tripod mount.buildthe istabilizer is very well built everything about it feels well made the clamping mechanism is strong and definitely does its job what i like particularly about this mount is that it will fit iphones with cases on something most do not as well as other smartphones this is a plus since not everyone has an iphone obviously resultswhile i use this primarily for stills it works nicely for a few short tutorials i put on youtube having a fluid ball-head tripod makes this thing a blast to use with the iphone and will greatly improve your shots i know that this is quite a big accessory nowadays for street reporters allowing someone to throw a smartphone on a tripod and get hd footage that is good enough for on-the-spot news reports i definitely enjoy using this even if it spend most of its time in my gear bag there are cheaper alternatives but this really is an excellent choice recommended,3.0,1.0,2,LS RB VBP DT NN VBP : CC RB VBZ WRB IN PRP VBP RB VBN RB FW MD RB VB NN NNS VBP NN VB PRP VBD RB DT NN VBN TO VB IN PRP VBZ RB DT NN CC DT NNP WDT VBZ JJ NNS WDT VBP VBD PRP$ NN IN VBG DT NN CC IN DT JJ NN RB WRB VBG NN NN JJ NN FW VBP RB VB TO VB TO VB RP PRP$ NN DT NN VBZ JJ NN NN IN NN NN CC RB NN IN PRP VBZ RB JJR TO VB RP PRP$ NN CC VB DT NN IN NNS VBP PRP TO PRP$ NN CC NN PRP TO NN FW VBD FW VBD DT NN NN NN VBZ RB RB VBN NN IN PRP VBZ RB VBN DT VBG NN VBZ JJ CC RB VBZ PRP$ NN WDT FW IN RB IN DT VBP VBZ IN PRP MD VB NNS IN NNS IN NN RBS VBP RB RB RB IN JJ NNS DT VBZ DT CC IN RB NN VBZ DT NN RB JJ FW VB DT RB IN NNS PRP VBZ RB IN DT JJ JJ NNS FW VBN IN NN VBG DT NN JJ NN VBZ DT NN DT NN TO VB IN DT NN CC MD RB VB PRP$ NNS FW VBP IN DT VBZ RB DT JJ NN RB IN NN NNS VBG NN TO VB DT NN IN DT NN CC VB JJ NN WDT VBZ JJ RB IN JJ NN NNS FW RB VB VBG DT RB IN PRP VBP JJS IN PRP$ NN IN PRP$ NN NN EX VBP JJR NNS CC DT RB VBZ DT JJ NN VBD,284

713,"do you need a basic but docx xlsx pptx capable version of real microsoft office openoffice not doing a good enough job for what you need are you put off by office two thousand and thirteen which does not offer three product keys for your trouble are you even more put off with microsoft turning office into software as a service with office three hundred and sixty-five well you are going to have to accept some compromises namely the hated ribbon and not having all the office apps but there are z number of people who have late windows xp early windows vista era pcs that are perfect for secondary production running windows seven from a retail upgrade disk-and when you do the clean install upgrade for windows which you will eventually have to do due to windows rot you are going to need office and you may never get up the budget to where you want to invest in office two thousand and ten or later for such a low-end often barely aero-capable pc so this is perfect as long as you temper your expectations.with properly set expectations and a legal copy of office two thousand and seven home and student you can now get down to how it works.it works by running basic word excel powerpoint and onenote tasks it is not going to wow you like a new version of office but a common thread i have read in hundreds of reviews for various versions and editions of office is why do they break what works in the previous version when they release a new version well by buying an older version there are no surprises as regards what office can and cannot do because it is been around for however many years it is been since the date the version in question office two thousand and seven home and student which is seven years as of when i write this was made.what can it actually do well word's fully featured as long as you are using it for home or student use excel is fully featured as regards the base program again the same caveat applies powerpoint will get your presentations done although you will miss some of the customizations of later versions onenote is fully featured and it along with powerpoint have the caveat that they are for home or student use the only thing that really lacks in home and student versus let us say ultimate which i use for troubleshooting through over-engineering is the microsoft office tools-you cannot expect fancy things like business contact manager and the accompanying copy of sql server two thousand and five express.in case you are wondering i am reviewing this for my aunt and uncle who sat there and bought a pc in may of two thousand and nine and thanks to a certain ability i have to troubleshoot combined with them buying retail windows seven home premium upgrade through the best buy fulfillment of the windows seven upgrade option that was current at the time along with retail office two thousand and seven home and student that they beat out of hp's customer dis service-albeit with having to pay for it i get to and thoroughly enjoy troubleshooting their pc whenever it is having an issue because i am on a mission to keep them off of the crack windows that is windows 8/ rt /8 one rt 8.1 windows phone 8x windows phone 8.1 x and i thoroughly enjoy every time i can fix their pc that uses this software.office two thousand and seven home and student was a change for them at first from the wordperfect office suite they were using on their old xp computer a dell dimension two thousand , four hundred they replaced it with an amd athlon sixty-four x2 seven thousand , seven hundred and fifty 4gb ram 500gb hd hp pavilion slimline s5120y but then again so was vista and then seven they did not have too much trouble with vista but windows seven home premium combined with this version of office makes them able to do everything they would ever want to do with office and a pc when that changes they will upgrade-and so far it is not changing i just think that office two thousand and seven whether lowly home and student or mighty ultimate or something in between like professional did not deserve the reputation it got as regards the ribbon people were and some still are so angry about the ribbon that they do not like office because of the ribbon i know i am not as qualified as some people to speak due to my aversion to command line interfaces whether of the old school dos unix variety or whether of the newfangled windows powershell variety but i know this for a fact once i properly configured their pc with windows seven home premium retail upgrade on a clean install and reimported their programs files and settings they were using it productively as could be until a virus hit that forced them to pay someone way too much to repair their computer i was able to set it right and from the moment i first showed them how to do basic things like bold underline italics margins indentation in other words showed them where microsoft office two thousand and seven home and student put the tools they were using in wordperfect office they have been happily using office with the ribbon i hate to discount those who have had negative experiences with office two thousand and seven because i do not like most change-especially not the licensing restrictions growing ever tighter since two thousand but i have not had any problems with the ribbon either.so with the ribbon discounted for us and our family we can now move on to infinitely more pressing matters which is how does office specifically two thousand and seven home and student perform in real world tasks well it does not make you have to renew the usage rights to it every year it supports the docx xlsx pptx trio and it has a user interface that aside from being different is actually usable if you can figure out what each button on each section of the ribbon is for which tooltips really help with that and they are on by default in summation for the reasons outlined above microsoft office two thousand and seven home and student is worth the money if you can get a legal copy i recommend it as long as it is needs match up well with what you need out of specifically microsoft office take this as you will two families experiences with office two thousand and seven one ultimate one home and student which is positive and we continue to use office two thousand and seven to this day",3.0,1.0,22,"VB PRP VB DT JJ CC NN NN NN JJ NN

756,i have tried many different noise canceling headphones and determined that the quiet comfort three are the best on the market at first these headphones sound like a piece of crap but after you break them in for about a week the sound is gorgeous when i first got these headphones i was stunned at the level of noise reduction to test them out i turned on some music on my home theater system then connected these headphones to a zune hd before the music on the zune even started playing i was amazed at how little i could hear from my home theater system when the music began playing i could not believe my ears i could not hear a sound but the audio quality was not the best and my ears felt like there were being sucked in after about five minutes of use i noticed i yawning quite a lot the next day i went out and bought the beats by dr dre and took them home to test them when i first put them on i noticed hard and striking bass the base in these headphones were actually better then the bose there was also pretty good treble as i started listening to these headphones a little bet more and the results were not to good in some songs the treble and bass were perfect but in other songs there was way to much base i did a little research on the beats and found out that these headphones were made for hip hop as stated by dr dre himself who is the creator of these headphones said that when he herd in the club by fifty cent was when he knew he had created the perfect headphones being an audiophile i was not really wild about this idea so i went back to the bose one thing i did like about the beats was that it has a mute button on the side when i started using the bose again i noticed that they sounded a lot better then they once did i was yawning significantly less my ears were not a sucked in and that the bose were a lot smaller and lighter the the beats so i returned the beats and kept the bose,3.0,1.0,2,LS VBP VBN JJ JJ NN VBG NNS CC VBD IN DT JJ NN CD VBP DT JJS IN DT NN IN JJ DT NNS VB IN DT NN IN NN CC IN PRP VBP PRP IN IN IN DT NN DT NN VBZ JJ WRB FW JJ VBD DT NNS FW VBD VBN IN DT NN IN NN NN TO VB PRP RP FW VBN RP DT NN IN PRP$ NN NN NN RB VBD DT NNS TO DT NN NN IN DT NN IN DT NN RB VBD VBG FW VBD VBN IN WRB JJ FW MD VB IN PRP$ NN NN NN WRB DT NN VBD VBG FW MD RB VB PRP$ NNS FW MD RB VB DT NN CC DT JJ NN VBD RB DT JJS CC PRP$ NNS VBD IN EX VBD VBG VBN IN IN IN CD NNS IN NN FW VBN LS VBG RB DT NN DT JJ NN FW VBD RB CC VBD DT NNS IN NN NN CC VBD PRP NN TO VB PRP WRB FW RB VB PRP IN FW VBD JJ CC JJ NN DT NN IN DT NNS VBD RB JJR RB DT NN EX VBD RB RB JJ NN IN FW VBD VBG TO DT NNS DT JJ NN RBR CC DT NNS VBD RB TO JJ IN DT NNS DT NN CC NN VBD JJ CC IN JJ NNS EX VBD NN TO JJ NN FW VBD DT JJ NN IN DT NNS CC VBN RP IN DT NNS VBD VBN IN NN NN IN VBN IN NN NN PRP WP VBZ DT NN IN DT NNS VBD IN WRB PRP NN IN DT NN IN CD NN VBD WRB PRP VBD PRP VBD VBN DT JJ NNS VBG DT NN FW VBD RB RB JJ IN DT NN IN FW VBD RB TO DT NN CD NN FW VBD IN IN DT NNS VBD IN PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT NN WRB FW VBN VBG DT NN RB FW VBD IN PRP VBD DT NN JJR RB PRP RB VBD FW VBD VBG RB RBR PRP$ NNS VBD RB DT VBN IN CC IN DT NN VBD DT NN JJR CC JJR DT DT NNS RB FW VBD DT NNS CC VBD DT NN,381

772,i have been using bitdefender for the past couple of years i found the two thousand and eight version for three computers for two years at a great price when it was running out i went looking for a similar deal and found one i noticed a couple of unpolished elements when installing there were a lot of dos command prompt windows opening in the background on the screen very briefly i did not have to interact with any of them and they went away almost immediately so there is no harm to it it is just a little unpolished i should also mention that the update for it is big it will ask to download the updated installer then after a few minutes when that is downloaded and run the updates for the program are currently over seventy-five mb i think that is probably the case with many anti-virus programs but just be aware if you are on dial-up you will be downloading for quite some time i uninstalled that old from a laptop and a desktop the desktop went fine but the laptop failed to uninstall i tried to get the uninstall program off bitdefender's website but the link they pointed to was dead eventually i found the cd and reinstalled which failed but the cd had the uninstaller which worked i only mention this because it is a little worrisome that if the last program had those issues that this version might when i eventually uninstall it i like this version of the program it has several different modes ranging from novice hides settings to expert showing all of it and is very easy to change between them my absolute favorite part though is the you are not fully protected system in past programs i have used if you disable some feature you constantly get the little alert icon that you are at risk bitdefender two thousand and ten lets you choose which of those things it monitors for so i did not want the anti-spam because i only use web mail so i told it not to bother me that i would deleted it it may be a small thing but to me it is a huge annoyance saver.so far i cannot tell if the scanner is faster or not it scans at only about a quarter of the number of files per second as the old program but it supposedly has an intelligent monitoring system which lets it avoid rescanning files that have not changed and thus could not have picked up an infection so while it was not that fast on the first scan in theory it will only get faster moving forward it intentionally skipped thousands of files.default is a daily scan which in my opinion is complete overkill unless you have a kid in your house if the resident protection is running all the time you can get by with once or twice a week thankfully the scheduling is very easy and you can even set the scans to take low priority which is a nice touch.in terms of detection bitdefender is not the highest rated scanner but it is far from the lowest it is an excellent budget anti-virus package and more than adequate for most people's needs considering how reasonable the pricing is i would happily recommend however since i have only used it a week or so if it does do anything really weird i will update my review to mention it.update 8/ 3/10- finally had to use my printer and guess what bitdefender has killed it i cannot use my network printer so i am dropping this review a couple stars i killed its firewall and turned the windows one on again guess what i can print again i wasted two hours dealing trying to fix it before i gave up unacceptable behavior in a firwall.ce saver so far i cannot tell if the scanner is faster or not it scans at only about a quarter of the number of

802,"i am a perennial naysayer when it comes to quicken's upgrades yes i agree with everyone who complains about intuit's business model of introducing mandatory upgrades periodically that one is forced to take because older versions become obsoleted but ultimately time marches on and software does need to be upgraded once having accepted the inevitible intuit notified me they would no longer be supporting premier two thousand and seven come april two thousand and ten i sighed a deep sigh and purchased quicken two thousand and ten rental property version for all practical intents and purposes this is quicken premier two thousand and ten with a couple extra bells and whistles so my review is for both products.after installing quicken property manager two thousand and ten i checked every account and report that was critical to me apart from the usual cosmetic gui differences i found nothing amiss the migration of data files went very smoothly and for once there is an aspect of quicken's upgrades worth the hassle now instead of four or five separate quicken files intuit manages to keep everything in one albeit larger file in terms of keeping track of backup files this is a significant improvement.also all settings and functionality remained intact downloading transactions from several brokerage accounts continue to work flawlessly i do not download transactions from banks or credit card companies i tried this once for an existing credit card account and ended up with hundreds of unwanted transactions in the upload if starting with a new credit card or bank account i imagine it would be nice to simply upload the transactions from the financial institution doing so into an existing account proved more hassle than i wanted to deal with so i continue to hand enter the couple dozen credit card transactions a month i deal with having recently acquired a rental property i opted for this version over quicken premier two thousand and ten whether or not the additional functionality of keeping a data base of rental properties is useful to you may depend on how many you have i only have the one and i already set up the transactions in the earlier version i am not sure its even worth my while to investigate this functionality but if you have many investment properties this might be a better way of keeping track of properties tennants income flow mortgage payments and tax related transaction this is the only funtional difference i see between quicken rental property two thousand and ten and quicken premier two thousand and seven i have investment accounts some with transaction going back to one thousand , nine hundred and eighty-two e g a mutual fund that i have been dollar cost averaging into since then so for managing my investment portfolio quicken premier is minimally a necessity on that front my only beefs are that one a graph that used to be available many versions ago is still sadly missing they used to have the ability to chart stock price history and market value on the same graph quite useful to see at a glance how well or poorly you timed the market with your purchases or sales luckily i get close to this functionality in fidelity's active trader charting two investment performance reporting continues to be problematic under certain circumstances performance statistics are annualized so at the beginning of a calendar year you could be looking at some grossly exaggerated performance numbers the same holds true for positions you only held for a short period of time what seems to be missing is a simple report that gives you the actual percentage gain or loss on a specific trade for example let us say you bought one hundred shares of xyz corp at ten per share today and you sold it tomorrow for eleven this is a simple ten actual gain ignoring transaction costs in quicken this is annualized to some phenominally large percentage as if you had earned ten per day for the entire year when analysing individual security performance this can be problematic three exporting to excel has never been a strong suit you can indeed export an account to excel but you cannot subsequently update an existing excel spreadsheet this is a pain it would be nice to develop reports in excel that quicken simply does not provide if you go throught the effort of exporting data to a spreadsheet it would be nice if you did not have to start from scratch every time now if i am simply undereducated in the use of excel then please someone out there direct me to the appropriate feature that would allow me to append a new month's worth of data to an existing spreadsheet via quicken export.now for the biggest improvement in the quicken experience since my last upgrade quicken actually has telephone support staff that call you when you have install or program issues i thought i found a bug in the net worth reporting in two thousand and ten i followed the support links under help and opted to have a quicken tech support person call me on the phone within minutes a very knowledgable support rep called me back and spent about an hour helping me debug the problem this included having me upload quicken premier seven uninstalling quicken two thousand and ten reinstalling the two thousand and seven program to see if the bug predated the two thousand and ten upgrade to make a long story short the problem orininated last year and had nothing to do with quicken two thousand and ten or the upgrade to said program now ultimately i did need to find the single transaction that hosed the report myself i deleted the transaction and reentered it bingo problem solved today i reinstalled quicken rental property two thousand and ten and am getting on with my life still i cannot say enough how stunned i am merely to know that after all these years of non-existant customer support intuit has finally delivered all in all i would say you need not be afraid of upgrading to quicken two thousand and ten none of the horror story events reported elsewhere amazon's reviews of quicken two thousand and ten happened if you check my reviewer history you will see that i have been highly critical of intuit in the past this upgrade has enough in it for me to justify the upgrade.good luckaccount to excel but you cannot subsequently update an existing excel spreadsheet this is a pain it would be

1003,"disclaimer i have had this lens for about three days now if anything changes i will update this review otherwise you can assume that i am still just as happy as i am now.before buying this i looked at every available uwa on the market for my nikon d3200 i checked the reviews including the ratings on dxomark's website great technical reference but it is all lab and no field ratings i found various professional reviews and read virtually every user review i could find in amazon and google shopping i looked at nikon's 10-24 mm the other tokina uwa's and other maker's lenses as well of all the lenses this one had the most positive and least negative reviews above all possibly tied with the tokina 11-16 the 11-16 is one f-stop faster and no-one had any autofocusing issues as were reported with some of the 11-24 s however no autofocus issues were reported on the 11-28 either on the nikon 10-24 most complaints were about vignetting and softness at the edges although some disliked the plastic instead of metal mount and that it is made in red china the fact that it costs around 1,000 it can now be found for about seven hundred and fifty not only motivated me to look a different lenses but frankly speaking ... given the reviews i expected more for that kind of money so i decided to take a chance on this lens instead of the 11-16 or 10-24.great choice :) i have shot about sixty pictures so far and this lens absolutely performs to my expectations and a little above to be honest fyi i shoot strictly raw and post process using dxolabs excellent optics pro software standard edition.sharpness is excellent from edge to edge regardless of zoom setting i have seen no sign of fringing even when shooting in dim light at f4 with a 1/15 shutter speed using iso four hundred and even iso one thousand low-light noise and graininess is the same as i get from all my other lenses at the same settings in fact ... i would say that the sharpness of this lens compares very favorably to my nikon prime 2.8 35mm which i absolutely love autofocus works exactly as advertised quite well and quickly but is slightly noisier than my nikons are i did however switch from single-point focus to multipoint during uwa shots and i think that the focusing of the lens was a bit quicker that way but that could simply be a subjective reaction.when zooming or using manual focus the feel of the lens is precise and smooth the shift from autofocus to manual is done by pulling the focus ring toward you which takes some getting used to ... but is brilliant no need to feel around for switches and hope you are not getting the vr switch instead of the a m switch on a nikon the barrel length does not change during zoom it is all internal and there is no zoom creep if you point the lens down or up i do wish that this lens had a vr feature but then again neither does my 35mm from nikon nor does the 10-24 mm from nikon either for me this means that i will need to bring my monopod when shooting uwa interior shots inside historical buildings and mansions where flash is forbidden but honestly that is no big deal i did not have vr during my film days so this was a common requirement.colors are accurate and well saturated i see no vignetting at any setting distortion is exactly what you would expect from a uwa and is easily corrected via dxolabs opticspro which has a module for this lens or you can use their stand-alone viewpoint product which costs less but gives you greater control over perspective corrections note viewpoint only handles jpgs so you will still need to have a post-processing software to export your raws you can also use adobe's lightroom to fix perspectives as well but that is a completely manual process if you shoot raw and do post-processing you really should take a look at dxolab's products especially opticspro.lastly the lens has a solid professional feel to it unlike the plastic nikons and some other brands it is reminiscent of my old series one lenses back from my film days ... there is no dust blowback from zooming into the camera since the zoom is internal and the docking collar is steel not plastic which is nice because it reduces concerns about fragility when spending five hundred on a lens.to sum it up this is probably the best uwa lens out there running at f four especially when you look at the cost i would buy this again :) if you want to see some of my tests go to mercerpics at smugmug and look for the tokina test gallery.postscript i took the lens with me today for a visit to my seven month old grandson along with my 35mm prime nikon lens now this should be no surprise to anyone ... but inside without a flash f four was a tough aperture to use due to slow shutter speeds at iso one hundred having said that about half the shots i took using the 12-28 still came out very sharp especially when shooting at 28mm i switched to my 35mm and ran it at f 2.8 simply because my grandson is a very active baby and i was getting too much motion blur with the f four tokina if you are planning on using the tokina inside without a flash you need still subjects and a monopod if shooting low iso s of course otherwise boost the iso which is not really a big deal on the new generation of dslr's they do a great job of keeping detail and reducing noise it is kind of hard to see a difference between iso one hundred and iso four hundred unless you are pixel peeping :) the reason i mention this is because when i use vr nikon lenses it is like picking up two f-stops ... and it is easy to forget that is not the case with either the tokina or the nikon prime lenses since i am planning on using this lens for inside architecture shots in somewhat dim historical homes running this through it is paces at extreme parameters in advance was a good idea outside shots in the sun were unbelievably sharp and clear fyi :) still loving this lens",3.0,1.0,24,NN FW VBP VBN DT NN IN IN CD NNS RB IN

1164,canon has kept the price of this little gem reasonable i bought it over a year ago and use it more than any other camera it fits nicely in my shirt pocket so i frequently have the camera with me on trips i always carry an extra battery with me because the battery indicator is not very reliable when it falls below full charge it seems to go from half full to zero in no time canon needs to work on this i have a dslr of comparable megapixels that takes slightly better pictures but it is hard to tell without looking at a large print or screen view color reproduction is as accurate as i can tell outdoor especially skin tones are the best i have seen i do not mind the lower level high definition video videos look pretty good on a large tv and unless you are after an academy award you probably will not miss the full one thousand and eighty hd it could use an optical viewfinder because you almost cannot see what you are shooting in full sun unless you shade the display but the optical viewfinder would come at the expense of the ultra compact size and i would rather have the small size also because of the size the controls are tiny and you have to get used to this eventually smart phones will have these photo and video capabilities unless there are large advances in ultra compact digital cameras i think most people will use smart phones instead so they will not have to carry around two gadgets in the meantime i will use this little camera,3.0,1.0,3,NN VBZ VBN DT NN IN DT JJ NN JJ FW VBD PRP IN DT NN RB CC VB PRP JJR IN DT JJ NN PRP VBZ RB IN PRP$ NN NN RB FW RB VBP DT NN IN PRP IN NNS FW RB VBP DT JJ NN IN PRP IN DT NN NN VBZ RB RB JJ WRB PRP VBZ IN JJ NN PRP VBZ TO VB IN DT JJ TO CD IN DT NN NN VBZ TO VB IN DT FW VBP DT NN IN JJ NNS WDT VBZ RB JJR NNS CC PRP VBZ JJ TO VB IN VBG IN DT JJ NN CC NN NN NN NN VBZ IN JJ IN FW MD VB JJ RB NN NNS VBP DT JJS FW VBP VBN FW VBP RB VB DT JJR NN JJ NN NN NNS VBP RB JJ IN DT JJ NN CC IN PRP VBP IN DT NN NN PRP RB MD RB VB DT JJ CD CD CC CD VBD PRP MD VB DT JJ NN IN PRP RB MD RB VB WP PRP VBP VBG IN JJ NN IN PRP NN DT NN CC DT JJ NN MD VB IN DT NN IN DT NN JJ NN CC FW MD RB VB DT JJ NN RB IN IN DT NN DT NNS VBP JJ CC PRP VBP TO VB VBN TO DT RB JJ NNS MD VB DT NN CC NN NNS IN EX VBP JJ NNS IN NN JJ JJ NNS FW VBP JJS NNS MD VB JJ NNS RB IN PRP MD RB VB TO VB RP CD NNS IN DT NN FW MD VB DT JJ NN,276

1203,my friend wanted a digital camera he was looking at still units but after he starting talking more about movies than stills i talked him into a video camera over a still camera this type of product has been out for awhile but most of them have been primitive needed tons of light and the videos were of generally low quality i have canon slr units their digital sensors are some of the best in my opinion so i started checking out this camera most consumer sites have glowing review after glowing review on the fs100 we have had this unit about three months we have used it quite a lot under mostly daylight conditions where these units most often fall down is in the amount of light they need to get good pictures my old tape camcorder can easily get good video in candle light this one is not quite that good but it is dang close most often with these units low light means unacceptably grainy images ... this unit does pretty well with that from what i have seen at least in middle quality mode the book states minimum light something like one hundred lux which is around dim room light after i got this i took it to the target parking lot at night and shot some video under just the parking lot mercury lamps ... i was looking for two things ... grainy images and color shifts caused by the non-daylight colored lamps in the parking area lighting i happened to catch a guy riding across the parking lot on his bike at a pretty good clip and tested the camera by tracking him across the lot and zooming in and out all the while ... the image was a bit grainy but it was acceptable and surprisingly good for a camera of this variety at night and under non daylight colored light ... i e canon's sensor is pretty darn good my first canon slr is pretty brain dead when it comes to mixed lighting situations but they seem to have straightened up their act in later products in that regard white balance logic there is a competing product of this type made by samsung the price isgenerally a bit lower than the canon i have looked at that unit but not had a chance to use one on that unit folks are saying the buttons are too flimsy another reason i went with this one we use this camera to shoot a lot of fast action sca heavy fighting i find that the default auto setting does not result in a fast enough shutter speed to catch very fast action this unit has a mode that allows you to choose the shutter speed while the camera chooses the aperature ... i fixed the blurred action by setting the camera shutter speed to 1/250 or faster and that has cured that issue completely i have not shot in full quality mode ... really do not need it ... middle quality mode is pretty darn good even displayed on a large flat panel although i am sure a true hd video snob would sniff indignantly at it this camera supports sdhd so you are not limited to two gig memory cards the sixteen gig cards are currently out like three hours in middle quality mode and thirty-two gig cards are also available but still too expensive if you get this camera i suggest you buy an image bank handheld self-powered device with notebook hard drive in it so you can clean off your cards and reuse them this camera does not have touch screen i really do not miss that at all the joystick is very serviceable i find the menus easy to navigate and the camera has a good variety of settings if i did not mention it before the camera can also take still images that are very acceptable overall what i think about it i like the camera i think if it was up to me i would redesign the zoom lever yes it is under your fingers as you hold the camera ... but i find it a little bit awkward especially when zooming in higher magnifications i would prefer to have the zoom on the back where i can hit it with my thumb canon does their usual thing of monopolizing batteries and accessories for this camera by not releasing tech specs so other companies can make products that work with it batteries are outrageous at eighty bucks plus each you can find them on amazon for around sixty but that is still outrageous in my book you can find knock off batteries on ebay that power the camera but they do not have the internal electronics and thus the camera cannot detect the charge and they will not charge on the camera one of your first purchases should be two sixteen gig sdhc cards they are not too high if you shop around four gig cards will suffice to start but get the biggest ones you can get and stick with a quality manufacturer as well i did not pick high speed cards for this camera i have not noticed lag caused because the camera buffers were full and could not write to the card fast enough ... at least not in mid quality mode ... high quality may be another issue what i am saying is i do not know if investing in the high speed memory cards is worth it for this item like it is for my professional slrs this is a great unit especially around the price that amazon has it for it is great to not have to digitize your movie you just pop out the card and play it with windows media player this unit also does not use any kind of custom format like some of the other cameras do it is stock mpeg two right off the camera so you do not have to translate it before windows can play it or roxio can burn it onto a cd dvd yes i would buy this again,3.0,1.0,7,PRP$ NN VBD DT JJ NN PRP VBD VBG IN

1400,i would have easily given this play food set five stars but for two details that bothered me with the wooden serving tray the first is that it is pictured both on amazon and on the box it came in as being solid wood it is not the bottom of the try is mdf that said it may be mdf created with e zero glues as i can detect absolutely no formaldehyde odor from it and i have a nose for vocs often much to my dismay the second detail is that there was a sharp shard of wood which had splintered up on the edge of the tray we glued it down with some elmer's time will tell if that holds it or if we will have to disfigure the tray by removing it and sanding it down however now that i have gotten those relatively minor gripes out of the way the rest of the set is pretty fantastic there are two main courses a veggie burger and a fish we are vegetarians so this is more food for the girls cats and bears and so forth which is something they really desired i might add both pieces cut into six and seven pieces respectively they are quite easy to cut and unlike many velcro-attached play foods the velcro is inlaid allowing the pieces to be flush with one another thus when the items are put together they look like whole solid pieces and do not just fall apart the veggie burger is finished with a durable chip-resistant matte paint stain and has grill imprints on one side the fish is unfinished wood and has grill imprints as well both are lovely the veggie burger can be adorned with a pat of butter the fish with a small slice of lemon these are not velcro attached the side dishes include four each of green beans fries and carrots these are are simple and easily-recognizable the fork and knife are natural wood with blue-stained handles and seem quite durable there is also an attractive thin cardboard insert with a lettuce bed and a few tomato slices which jazzes up the not-as-attractive-as-advertised mdf-bottomed serving tray sadly i am not convinced this piece will last very long as it is just too bendy but i suppose it would be easy enough to make your own variation to replace it the scale of the food is almost relative to our haba erzi and plan toys play food collection probably a wee bit larger but a wee bit smaller than something like melissa and doug nonetheless i could see it pleasing fans of both it does have the distinctive advantage over melissa and doug of no reeking of formaldehyde and other mystery chemicals and claims to have been processed in an ecologically sustainable and socially responsible manner bottom line no doubt i would buy this again save for the tray this set is beautifully crafted and very high quality it will last and last it is got a fantastic array of play stuff for an unusually fair price oh and my five-year old daughter played with it for two hours after it arrived today so it is got her seal of approval,3.0,1.0,3,LS MD VB RB VBN DT NN NN VBD CD NNS CC IN CD NNS WDT VBD PRP IN DT JJ VBG NN DT JJ VBZ IN PRP VBZ VBN DT IN NN CC IN DT NN PRP VBD IN IN VBG JJ NN PRP VBZ RB DT NN IN DT NN VBZ NN WDT VBD PRP MD VB JJ VBN IN SYM CD NNS IN FW MD VB RB DT NN NN IN PRP CC FW VBP DT NN IN NNS RB JJ TO PRP$ NN DT JJ NN VBZ IN EX VBD DT JJ NN IN NN WDT VBD JJ RP IN DT NN IN DT NN PRP VBD PRP RP IN DT NN POS NN MD VB IN DT VBZ PRP CC IN PRP MD VB TO VB DT NN IN VBG PRP CC VBG PRP RP RB RB IN FW VBP VBN DT RB JJ NNS IN IN DT NN DT NN IN DT NN VBZ RB JJ EX VBP CD JJ NNS DT JJ NN CC DT NN PRP VBP NNS RB DT VBZ RBR NN IN DT NNS NNS CC NNS CC RB RB WDT VBZ NN PRP RB VBD FW MD VB DT NNS VBD IN CD CC CD NNS RB PRP VBP RB JJ TO VB CC IN JJ JJ NN NNS DT NN VBZ VBN VBG DT NNS TO VB JJ IN CD DT RB WRB DT NNS VBP VBN RB PRP VBP IN JJ JJ NNS CC VBP RB RB VB RB DT JJ NN VBZ VBN IN DT JJ JJ NN NN VB CC VBZ NN NNS IN CD NN DT NN VBZ JJ NN CC VBZ NN NNS RB RB DT VBP JJ DT JJ NN MD VB VBN IN DT NN IN NN DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN JJ DT VBP RB VB VBN DT NN NNS VBP CD DT IN JJ NNS NNS CC NNS DT VBP VBP JJ CC JJ DT NN CC NN VBP JJ NN IN JJ VBZ CC VBP RB JJ EX VBZ RB DT JJ JJ NN NN IN DT NN NN CC DT JJ NN NNS WDT VBZ RP DT JJ JJ VBG NN RB FW VBP RB VBN DT NN MD VB RB RB IN PRP VBZ RB RB JJ CC FW VB PRP MD VB JJ JJ TO VB PRP$ JJ NN TO VB PRP DT NN IN DT NN VBZ RB JJ TO PRP$ NN NN CC NN NNS VBP NN NN RB DT NN NN JJR CC DT NN RB JJR IN NN IN NN CC NN RB FW MD VB PRP VBG NNS IN CC PRP VBZ VB DT JJ NN IN NN CC NN IN DT NN IN NN CC JJ NN NNS CC NNS TO VB VBN VBN IN DT RB JJ CC RB JJ NN NN NN DT NN FW MD VB DT RB VB IN DT NN DT NN VBZ RB VBN CC RB JJ NN PRP MD VB CC VB PRP VBZ VBD DT JJ NN IN NN NN IN DT RB JJ NN UH CC PRP$ JJ JJ NN VBN IN PRP IN CD NNS IN PRP VBD NN IN PRP VBZ VBD PRP$ NN IN NN,539
1401,i like puzzles that make sense and these did you push a button you see the result without having to hunt around for what is going on for example in mysterious journey two there is several puzzles where you have to form a circuit or connect one side of a grid to another by clicking on dials ... very straight-forward puzzles draw the grids out and it is not difficult to work out on paper in another you find your way across a fog enshrouded pathway very cool by plotting the path from below.while there is very little having to combine information from several sources to figure out a puzzle it does occur once or twice druing the main part of the game and again at the end and there is a few math-based puzzles too in varying degrees of difficulty hey that is what universal hint system is for still gamers with more experience than i might not have much problem wtih them.an earlier reviewer mentioned that half the time a puzzle led to nothing just an area to look out of i am not sure where the reviewer is referring to but i did not find that to be true you open a door and there is something to find learn about in a cut-scene see or do behind it.the storyline is interesting and well developed and the ending is satisfying.as far as graphics i am not a tech person but i found them to be very pretty i wish i could have roamed a bit more in a few places the graphics looked just too inviting to simply view from afar the landscape is filled with bright colors and intriguing designs this is not click and point so you are able to move about freely.the music is not great but at least it does not detract from the game the voices are fine a cut above most games the mechanical voices are done with a bit of special effects a nice touch the computer-rendered people move fairly naturally you have little control over settings but in my experience the game ran fine athlon 64x2 geforce 7600gs i wish there were more games like this puzzles clues that are scattered hither and yon only to make little sense is not my idea of fun i would recommend mysterious journey two to anyone who wants an easier game that does not over-tax their brain.rce 7600gs i wish there were more games like this puzzles clues that are scattered hither and yon only to make little sense is not my idea of fun i would recommend mysterious journey two to anyone who wants an easier game that does not over-tax their brain,3.0,1.0,3,LS IN NNS WDT VBP NN CC DT VBD PRP VB DT NN PRP VBP DT NN IN VBG TO NN IN IN WP VBZ VBG IN IN NN IN JJ NN CD EX VBZ JJ NNS WRB PRP VBP TO VB DT NN CC VB CD NN IN DT NN TO DT IN VBG IN NNS : RB JJ NNS VBP DT NNS IN CC PRP VBZ RB JJ TO VB RP IN NN IN DT PRP VB PRP$ NN IN DT NN JJ NN RB JJ IN VBG DT NN IN JJ EX VBZ RB JJ VBG TO VB NN IN JJ NNS TO VB RP DT NN PRP VBZ VB RB CC RB VBG DT JJ NN IN DT NN CC RB IN DT NN CC EX VBZ DT JJ JJ NNS RB IN VBG NNS IN NN NN WDT VBZ WP JJ NN NN VBZ IN RB NNS IN JJR NN IN FW MD RB VB JJ NN VBP RB JJR NN VBD IN PDT DT NN DT NN VBD TO NN RB DT NN TO VB IN IN FW VBP RB JJ WRB DT NN VBZ VBG TO CC FW VBD RB VB IN TO VB JJ PRP VBP DT NN CC EX VBZ NN TO VB VB RB IN DT JJ VBP CC VBP IN JJ NN VBZ JJ CC RB VBN CC DT VBG VBZ JJ RB IN NNS FW VBP RB DT NN NN CC FW VBN PRP TO VB RB RB FW NN FW MD VB VBN DT NN RBR IN DT JJ NNS DT NNS VBD RB RB VBG TO RB VB IN IN DT NN VBZ VBN IN JJ NNS CC JJ NNS DT VBZ RB VB CC VB RB PRP VBP JJ TO VB RB JJ NN VBZ RB JJ CC IN JJS PRP VBZ RB VB IN DT NN DT NNS VBP JJ DT NN IN JJS NNS DT JJ NNS VBP VBN IN DT NN IN JJ NNS DT JJ NN DT JJ NNS VBP RB RB PRP VBP JJ NN IN NNS CC IN PRP$ NN DT NN VBD JJ NN JJ NN NNS FW NN EX VBD JJR NNS IN DT NNS NNS WDT VBP VBN RB CC RB RB TO VB JJ NN VBZ RB PRP$ NN IN NN FW MD VB JJ NN CD TO NN WP VBZ DT JJR NN WDT VBZ RB VB PRP$ NN NNS FW NN EX VBD JJR NNS IN DT NNS NNS WDT VBP VBN RB CC RB RB TO VB JJ NN VBZ RB PRP$ NN IN NN FW MD VB JJ NN CD TO NN WP VBZ DT JJR NN WDT VBZ RB VB PRP$ NN,452

1439,"originally released in one thousand , nine hundred and seventy-six get closer is the 8th proper seals crofts album and incredibly despite its gold-selling status as well as the presence of the top ten soft rock staple that is the title track it is taken over thirty years for this album in full to get cd release in the us if not the whole world if you read through the original album liner notes before listening you would come across some seemingly discouraging signs only eight songs with a total duration of less than thirty-five minutes plus an album-closer that runs well over six minutes a closer look and you will see two songs copyrighted one thousand , nine hundred and sixty-nine and an additional one copyrighted one thousand , nine hundred and seventy-two and in fact the opening song sweet green fields had already been recorded way back in the 60s by the knickerbockers famed for their infamous beatles knockoff lies all of this inescapably gets one thinking that jim dash were probably burning out and or under pressure to crank out an album before the start of a tour and or to meet a warners brothers deadline maybe they were under pressure hardly an unlikely scenario in the record business but despite all of that get closer somehow ends up being the most consistently engaging album seals crofts made during their 1969-1980 run a fantastic album that is carefully crafted flawlessly professional yet still passionately sung and played the opening sweet green fields is a marvelous epic with edgy verses a feel-good chorus and a soaring bridge section it is followed by the title track--the odds that anyone reading this has never heard the song is so slim that i suppose i just as well refrain from comment but suffice it to say that it is a great soft rock anthem regardless of how sick to death of it you might be and understandably so and carolyn willis co-lead vocals help underline its gospel leaning the next track red long ago is another brilliant epic with a simple yet irresistibly dreamy looping piano line played by david paich andbracing dynamics the closing track on side one in vinyl terms provides some respite from all the preceeding drama with a relatively short and lightweight albeit really fun and catchy tune called goodbye old buddies which was written by parker mcgee the same guy who wrote i would really love to see you tonight and other songs for england dan john ford coley ); mcgee recorded his own version of this song for his lone self-titled album also released in one thousand , nine hundred and seventy-six but the seals crofts version with a typically excellent lead vocal spotlight from dash crofts is easily the preferrable version side two opens with baby blue which starts off sounding like a rather pedestrian 70s mid-tempo pop-rock ballad albeit pleasant but then goes on to achieve greatness with its out-of-nowhere wistful yet bouncy bridge section punctuated by a memorable lead guitar line million dollar horse despite somewhat strange lyrics is a beautiful heartstring-tugging ballad as is the poetic do not fail which is even more poignant it is somewhat incredible to think that james seals had do not fail waiting in the wings for five years before it finally appearing on album maybe they would tried to record it earlier but were unsatisfied with the results especially considering some of the lesser compositions that were used on earlier albums the album ends with passing thing which has some french lyrics not to mention a lovely melody although it is mostly another one of their instrumental showcases giving jim dash a chance to duel it out on acoustic guitar and mandolin respectively only on this final track does it really feel like jim dash were padding the album to compensate for lack of material but it is still a thoroughly enjoyable piece displaying all-around impeccable musicianship and it is interesting to hear the honest-to-goodness drum machine that crops up on the second half of the track yes they did indeed have them back in the 70s although it hardly sounds like what you have probably come to associate drum machines with in other words they are hardly foreshadowing 80s dance-pop or 90s electronica as usual get closer was produced by louie shelton and if the album sounds a bit more steely dan-ish than you remember that is easily explained by the fact that seals crofts were using many of the same players including larry carlton guitar jim horn saxophone and future toto members david paich keyboards and jeff porcaro drums rhino flashback has provided a long overdue cd reissue of this must-have album although in typical fashion of their flashback division rhino has unfortunately skimped on the packaging no musician credits etc although in compensation the list price is ultra-low in the end this is a great album from a great duo that has been known to get an unkind and unfair bad rap over the years get closer is seals

1464,triggerfinger is a power-trio from belgium that has been steadily getting better and bigger over there from their self-titled two thousand and four album and on to two thousand and eight s what grabs ya in two thousand and ten came the band highly-anticipated third studio album if you are not familiar with triggerfinger's sound think heavy guitar-based rock not unlike say the child of a foo fighters queens of the stone age black sabbath merger all this dancin around eleven tracks fifty-one min kick off with the furious title track and we are off to the races let it ride is anotehr short take-no-prisoners song on love lost in love singer-songwriter ruben block starts deviating from the straight-on rock and that is actually good news as we get to hear different sides of the band all night long is an outright slow song with block's vocals heavily distorted the epic feed me closes off the first half of the album nicely the second half of the album starts with a blazing cherry check out in particular the intro there are several longer songs as well including the eight min slow-burner my baby's got a gun and the six min album closer it has not gone away which in and of itself sums up the album nicely.in all this is a very good album i might have left off the weakest song so as to get a slightly shorter and more concise running time but it is a minore quibble by reputation the band really shines in concert they released a live album in two thousand and seven faders up live and are about to release another live album live at high voltage later this fall i have not gotten the opportunity to see them live but i can only hope they will tour the us at some point as an aside triggerfinger is one of a core group of up-and-coming belgian bands worth checking out see in particular also the black box revelantion and customs,3.0,1.0,1,NN VBZ DT NN IN NN WDT VBZ VBN RB VBG JJR CC JJR IN RB IN PRP$ JJ CD CD CC CD NN CC IN TO CD CD CC CD NNS WDT NNS PRP IN CD CD CC CD VBD DT NN JJ JJ NN NN IN PRP VBP RB JJ IN NN POS NN VBP JJ JJ NN RB IN VB DT NN IN DT NN NNS NNS IN DT NN NN JJ NN NN PDT DT NN IN NNS VBZ CD NN NN RP IN DT JJ NN NN CC PRP VBP RB TO DT NNS VBP PRP VB VBZ JJ JJ NNS NN IN NN VBN IN NN NN NN NN VBZ VBG IN DT JJ NN CC DT VBZ RB JJ NN IN PRP VBP TO VB JJ NNS IN DT NN DT NN RB VBZ DT RB JJ NN IN NN POS NNS RB VBD DT NN VB PRP VBZ RP DT JJ NN IN DT NN RB DT JJ NN IN DT NN VBZ IN DT VBG NN NN IN IN JJ DT NN EX VBP JJ JJR NNS RB RB VBG DT CD NN NN PRP$ NN POS VBD DT NN CC DT CD NN NN RBR PRP VBZ RB VBN RB WDT IN CC IN PRP NNS IN DT NN NN PDT DT VBZ DT RB JJ NN FW MD VB VBN RP DT JJS NN RB IN TO VB DT RB JJR CC RBR JJ VBG NN CC PRP VBZ DT NN NN IN NN DT NN RB VBZ IN NN PRP VBD DT JJ NN IN CD CD CC CD NNS IN JJ CC VBP IN TO VB DT JJ NN VB IN JJ NN RB DT NN FW VBP RB VBN DT NN TO VB PRP VB CC FW MD RB VB PRP MD VB DT PRP IN DT NN IN DT RB NN VBZ CD IN DT NN NN IN JJ JJ NNS JJ VBG RP VB IN JJ RB DT JJ NN NN CC NNS,336

1491,office three hundred and sixty-five is microsoft's latest bright idea for how to get us to subscribe to the software we once bought for forty-nine a year you get office two thousand and thirteen on a pc or office two thousand and eleven on a mac plus more-robust versions of the tablet phone versions of office than you get for free you also get 1tb of space in microsoft's cloud and the ability to sync a doc from anywhere you edit it sort of like a keychain usb drive except no physical drive plus some skype minutes 1tb of space is nothing to sneeze at and paying an annual fee for drive space is industry standard practice.for me the installation on the pc went fine even though i had word two thousand and ten already i am happy with the features added in two thousand and thirteen over two thousand and ten particularly for excel the ipad version is about as good as you might expect and with office three hundred and sixty-five you get to edit docs from onedrive.so far so good but does it make sense to go for this version if you have lots of devices get office three hundred and sixty-five home which supports installs on five devices if you do not trust cloud storage and do not need onedrive and syncing search out the regular home and office or home and business versions one purchase price covers you forever or until hardware os incompatibilities end that dream.if at the end of my subscription year i have actually used onedrive a lot i will renew using my own money if i like the two thousand and thirteen version of office enough but do not use the cloud storage i will buy a permanent license for two thousand and thirteen ... assuming they still sell such a thing i hope they do at the retail level rental software benefits the vendor far more than the buyer,3.0,1.0,6,NN CD CD CC CD VBZ NN POS JJS JJ NN IN WRB TO VB PRP TO VB TO DT NN PRP RB VBD IN CD DT NN PRP VBP NN CD CD CC CD IN DT NN CC NN CD CD CC NNS IN DT NN CC JJR NNS IN DT NN NN NNS IN NN IN PRP VBP IN JJ PRP RB VBP CD IN NN IN NN POS NN CC DT NN TO NN DT NN IN RB PRP VB PRP NN IN IN DT NN NN NN IN DT JJ NN CC DT NN NNS CD IN NN VBZ NN TO VB IN CC VBG DT JJ NN IN NN NN VBZ NN JJ NN PRP DT NN IN DT NN VBD JJ RB IN FW VBD NN CD CD CC CD RB FW VBP JJ IN DT NNS VBD IN CD CD CC CD IN CD CD CC CD RB IN VB DT NN NN VBZ RB RB JJ IN PRP MD VB CC IN NN CD CD CC CD PRP VBP TO VB NNS IN JJ RB RB JJ CC VBZ PRP VB NN TO VB IN DT NN IN PRP VBP NNS IN NNS VBP NN CD CD CC CD NN WDT VBZ NNS IN CD NNS IN PRP VBP RB NN NN NN CC VBP RB VB JJ CC NN NN IN DT JJ NN CC NN CC NN CC NN NNS CD NN NN VBZ PRP RB CC IN NN NNS NNS VBP IN NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN NN FW VBP RB VBN JJ DT NN FW MD VB VBG PRP$ JJ NN IN FW IN DT CD CD CC CD NN IN NN RB CC VBP RB VB DT NN NN FW MD VB DT JJ NN IN CD CD CC CD : VBG PRP RB VBP JJ DT NN FW VBP PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN JJ NN NNS DT NN RB RBR IN DT NN,329

1513,well after reading all the great reviews on these headpohones i decided to give them a try as i feared they are a gimmick these headphones have a vibrating thing that sits on the back of your neck while it is designed to simulate the heavy bass of a real home theater system it ended up making me shake my head both uncontrollably and because i feel like such a sucker for purchasing these things the shaking mechanism produces no actual sound of bass just a rythmic pulsing sounds cool it is not and to top it all off the headphones are rather uncomfortable i do not recommend these for long listening sessions but their bulky clumsy design makes them difficult to walk even a short distance with so sitting down seems to be the only venue for listening to be fair however these headphones produce some fairly decent sound midrange sound seems almost absent however and everyhing seems to have a slightly high pitch to it with the vmss bass system turned off the drivers still manage to produce some decent bass but not enough that i would justify the ... price tag and the so-so mid and high range sound is nothing to die for either and for the aesthetically-conscious teen like myself these headphones look absolutely horrid i do not think i would walk around with them unless i was in my grandmother's nursing home in short if you want to buy into a gimmicky product then go ahead and purchase the brain shaker extreme headphones but if you are like me and you want a pair of portable decent-sounding phones look elsewhere,0.0,0.0,2,RB IN VBG PDT DT JJ NNS IN DT NNS FW VBD TO VB PRP DT NN IN FW VBN PRP VBP DT NN DT NNS VBP DT VBG NN WDT VBZ IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN IN PRP VBZ VBN TO VB DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN NN NN PRP VBD RP VBG PRP VB PRP$ NN CC RB CC RB FW VB IN PDT DT NN IN VBG DT NNS DT VBG NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN RB DT JJ JJ NNS VBP PRP VBZ RB CC TO VB PRP DT RP DT NNS VBP RB JJ FW VBP RB VB DT IN JJ VBG NNS CC PRP$ JJ JJ NN VBZ PRP JJ TO VB RB DT JJ NN IN RB VBG RP VBZ TO VB DT JJ NN IN VBG TO VB JJ RB DT NNS VBP DT RB JJ NN JJ NN VBZ RB JJ RB CC VBG VBZ TO VB DT RB JJ NN TO PRP IN DT NN NN NN VBD RP DT NNS RB VBP TO VB DT JJ NN CC RB RB IN FW MD VB DT : NN NN CC DT JJ JJ CC JJ NN NN VBZ NN TO VB IN DT CC IN DT JJ NN IN PRP DT NNS VBP RB JJ FW VBP RB VB FW MD VB IN IN PRP IN FW VBD IN PRP$ NN POS NN NN IN JJ IN PRP VBP TO VB IN DT JJ NN RB VB RB CC VB DT NN NN JJ NNS CC IN PRP VBP IN PRP CC PRP VBP DT NN IN JJ JJ NNS VBP RB,276

1565,rhythm games are not my sort of thing that is why i found myself surprised to be enjoying this game so much the main advantage that this game has over its competitors is a good story with gameplay features borrowed from professor layton and extremely catchy beats i found myself humming the tunes from this fairly shortly after playing it for the first time.the plot of the game is focused around a young frenchman called raphael who goes around by night disguised as the notorious phantom r an art thief of great style and sophistication the police are baffled at the ability of this young redheaded thief in a fashionable suit and fedora to disappear undoubtedly they asked the random redheaded civilian with glasses and no hat for information but he did not see anything it is that kind of game raphael is searching for his father who went missing years before during his pursuit he finds himself entwined in the risen emperor napoleon's dastardly plans to take over the world fortunately his men are susceptible to timed dance moves.sound ridiculous good it is meant to the plot is one of the most entertaining things about this game amusing and insane it takes our heroes on a tour of paris and its environs and paris is very much on display here the city looks gorgeous even in the 2d that dominates the gameplay when you do get to see a cinematic cutscene in glorious 3d no less it really sours.the rhythm games are cleverly based around this plot for example when sneaking into the louvre you have to follow a beat to hide behind convenient statues and avoid the guards when fighting napoleon's men you have to punch them as they bounce at you in synchronized fashion when eluding policemen on roller skates you have to jump or duck to avoid capture and my personal favorite you get to defend yourself against your archrival's pi child charlie who attempts to apprehend you by kicking a flaming football at your face they are all fun not a little bit silly and have a catchy beat.the parts of the game not revolving around playing rhythm games owe a very large debt to professor layton not so much the puzzle aspect but the way that you move your character along a map and use the touchscreen to interact with the characters and scenery on it they even have playcoins you can collect by tapping random areas of the screen the character and street designs are very nice these are seen at their full effect when the cutscenes start these cutscenes are beautifully animated and really capture a spirit of adventure i wish they would make this into an anime so we could see it all animated the 3d is used to good effect in these especially the first cutscene which has raphael dancing around a room filled with chandeliers the rest of the game does not use it much and it is often easier to just turn it off.most of this game takes place on the bottom screen the top screen has a map and is used for all the wonderful 3d cutscenes but when traveling you pay attention to the touchscreen in battles the top screen becomes important these battles alternate between having you tap buttons on the bottom screen with your stylus and hitting buttons no you do not have to do both at the same time that would be horrifyingly difficult.the downsides to the game are fairly minor but annoying the rating system is messed up the game does not record your best scores only an average of all your scores this means that if you want the game to save you getting an a-rank score you have to get it right on your first time which is almost impossible another flaw is the grading system for these ranks it is too heavily focused on what your last move was you can get a perfect score right up until the end and then flub only the last note dropping you down to a c-rank it is very irritating.if any of this sounds compelling try the demo it is available for free on the nintendo store this is one fun game even for non rhythm game fans while the game does not always add up to the sum of its parts nevertheless it provides a fun ride.do store this is one fun game even for non rhythm game fans while the game does not always add up to the sum of its parts nevertheless it

1569,the changlings produce a form of music that is both modern and medieval it unites a traditional celtic style with modern instruments a middle eastern flair and a deep dark gothic mood the vocals are clear and beautiful ranging from ethereal to haunting the musical backing is very full and complex with every part precisely orchestrated and executed while still producing a freely organic sound it does not just compliment the vocals but seems merges with regeana's voice to form a sound greater than the sum of its parts if you have heard the original changlings cd the only one still available this cd will be familiar but with a much darker undertone the music and vocals are still haunting and will linger in your consciousness long after the music stops i would not consider any of it spooky rather than approaching the mystical unknown it immerses the listener in the dark murky depths of the human experience the album seems to follow only incidentally the theme of a space voyage as though it was only an afterthought individually each song is very strong collectively they are less impressive than they would be without trying to follow the space theme none the less it is definitely a top notch work of art this cd ranks near the top of my list of favorites along with cd's from aenima mirabilis and mercurine,3.0,1.0,3,DT NNS VBP DT NN IN NN WDT VBZ DT JJ CC JJ PRP VBZ DT JJ JJ NN IN JJ NNS DT JJ JJ NN CC DT JJ JJ JJ NN DT NNS VBP JJ CC JJ VBG IN JJ TO VBG DT JJ NN VBZ RB JJ CC JJ IN DT NN RB VBN CC VBN IN RB VBG DT RB JJ NN PRP VBZ RB RB VB DT NNS CC VBZ NNS IN NN POS NN TO VB DT JJ JJR IN DT NN IN PRP$ NNS IN PRP VBP VBN DT JJ NNS VBD DT JJ CD RB JJ DT NN MD VB JJ CC IN DT JJ JJR NN DT NN CC NNS VBP RB VBG CC MD VB IN PRP$ NN RB IN DT NN VBZ FW MD RB VB DT IN PRP JJ RB IN VBG DT JJ JJ PRP VBZ DT NN IN DT JJ JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN DT NN VBZ TO VB RB RB DT NN IN DT NN NN IN IN PRP VBD RB DT JJ RB DT NN VBZ RB JJ RB PRP VBP RBR JJ IN PRP MD VB IN VBG TO VB DT NN NN NN DT JJR PRP VBZ RB DT JJ NN NN IN NN DT NN VBZ IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN IN NNS IN IN NN POS IN FW FW CC FW,231

1604,this review is going to be much like my review of the two thousand and nine edition of norton three hundred and sixty because except for the removal of the backup features the two programs are quite alike for the same reason i am not going to be so nice to symantec the makers of norton three hundred and sixty and norton internet security this time around i want to be clear that i am only referring to the windows xp version in this review i may post another one for windows seven users once my new system arrives.the main problem is this you absolutely cannot trust the firewall to work correctly on your system as configured as it is too permissive this means you run the risk of losing valuable personal information and or damaging your computer in the default set it and forget it mode it has continued to fail in almost every firewall test i have thrown at it as it does a horrible job of detecting and blocking potential threats on its own even a free firewall program provided by comodo performs better than norton internet security.the only way to make the firewall safe is to do the following steps one open the norton internet security homepage by doubleclicking on the icon in the system tray two in the box named network click on settings three scroll down to smart firewall click configure next to advanced settings four turn automatic program control off and advanced events monitoring on5 you will get a warning that it is for advanced users congratulations that is what you will become soon six hit apply to accept if your settings are correct it should match the image i uploaded to amazon.from this point forward it will start to ask you before you start a program or access the internet much like the previously referenced comodo firewall it will seem annoying at first however the interruptions will become less frequent as it learns the programs that you have designated as safe you may not recognize each individual file but you can make educated guesses for instance if the file is located in the directory of the program you just started up it is a high probability the file is legitimate because norton has started including file directories in its popup alerts it becomes much easier to locate files you are unsure of from there you can check the properties of the file to make sure they match the program's vendor microsoft or otherwise it just depends on how accepting you want to be after a while the interruptions will become infrequent unless you install something new or more importantly something uninvited is trying to access the internet without your permission it is not a foolproof method by any means but it is much safer than the norton three hundred and sixty and is two thousand and ten default which seems to be to allow anything you run to access the internet and or your computer as long as you perform these steps the firewall performs quite well.fortunately i can say that the antivirus works much better it even identified and quarantined a few of my firewall leaktests before i was able to run them no virus protector is one hundred safe however so the best way to protect your computer is still to practice safe surfing when i deliberately tried to run some questionable files one of them managed to make my computer unbootable and norton never stopped it the same thing happened to norton three hundred and sixty this brings me to another issue i sent that file to symantec months ago with specific details about what it does yet even now norton does not catch it i am starting to wonder how much they are paying attention to the files we send them maybe they are being overrun by the number of people submitting iexplore.exe as a potential virus.the database is still a mess of unnecessary messages that are service related rather than virus related there does seem to be some realization of this so this years version is a little less confusing with links to the database regarding particular issues youmay click on cosmetically norton has changed to yellow over black instead of black over yellow there is a nice buried feature called optimize to get there you need to flip the main menu to the performance history and click a tiny link of the same name not sure why it is tucked away but for this aging system i did notice some improvement in startup times symantec will honor the remaining days of a subscription to a former product and add them to this year's product but you will have to contact them it will also transfer your settings and identity cards and passwords however it will not use your identity card information on new websites per support you need to delete them in spite of the import and start over i also find it takes much longer to login than it did using norton three hundred and sixty almost a 10-15 second wait not sure if that was due to the import or a problem with the program.norton internet security two thousand and ten says on the box that it supports pop three and smtp now for its email scanner that would cover almost every email scanner on the market in symantec's world however that only means outlook and outlook express according to a support guy named kumar he says that in spite of the many popular email programs on the market norton continues to support only outlook and outlook express but he could not really explain why symantec appears to be flat out lying maybe he was stoned i will ask harold next time.one new feature that does not impress me are the constant popups saying i am the first person to run this program or that quite odd considering i get these warnings even after downloading a file from the symantec website you can remove this annoyance by clicking web settings then turning off download insight you have to turn it off completely otherwise it will simply delete any file it considers a risk one of these days symantec will realize we do not like it when they do that.in short this version of norton is not much of an improvement over last year's version and there were a ton of areas where they could have made improvements.lack instead of black over yellow there is a nice buried feature called optimize to get there you need to flip the main menu to the performance history and click a tiny link of the same name not sure why it is tucked away but for this aging system i did notice some improvement in startup times symantec will honor the remaining days of a subscription to a former product and add them to this year's product but you will have to contact them it will also transfer your settings and identity cards and passwords however it will not use your identity card information on new websites per support you need to delete them in spite of the import and start over i also find it takes much longer to login than it did using norton three hundred and sixty almost a 10-15 second wait not sure if that was due to the import or a problem with the program norton internet security two thousand and ten says on the box that it supports pop three and smtp now for its email scanner that would cover almost every email scanner on the market in symantec's world however that only means outlook and outlook express according to a support guy named kumar he says that in spite of the many popular email programs on the market norton continues to support only outlook and outlook express but he could not really explain why symantec appears to be flat out lying maybe he was stoned i will ask harold next time one new feature that does not impress me are the constant popups saying i am the first person to run this program or that quite odd considering i get these warnings even after downloading a file from the symantec website you can remove this annoyance by clicking web settings then turning off download insight you have to turn it off completely otherwise it will simply delete any file it considers a risk one of these days symantec will realize we do not like it when they do that in short this version of norton is not much of an improvement over last year's version and there were a ton of areas where they could have made improvements,3.0,1.0,6,DT NN VBZ VBG TO VB RB IN PRP$ NN IN DT CD CD

1723,i had a wonderful pair of sony earbuds before which were similar to these but unfortunately my cat chewed them completely apart ... those were the best i would owned and i wish i still had them or knew where to find them regardless i had to find a replacement and so invested in the most similar pair of earbuds i could find in the hook style but i tried philips those were god-awful and the left earbud burned out after a short while.so this was my next option once i found it from my past experience and my father's headphones which are sony incredibly ancient and working like a charm i figured i could not go wrong.the cord comes with an extender that is incredibly long i absolutely loved that unfortunately on a road trip no less i had a scare where these earbuds were dying on me too you know where you will need to turn the jack in your ipod in order for the sound to come through properly not good turns out the problem was the extender once i deatched that the earbuds worked fine and have been working fine ever since my issue is that the cord is now unusually short but i suppose that has its benefits and i have learned to live with it.now sound quality i have no idea how to judge earbuds on sound quality so i had to experiment until i found a kind that was decent these are excellent if you try earbuds like these you will never go back to the kind that comes with the ipod i will save you time and tell you now to not bother with earbuds that do not cushion inside your ear unless you absolutely cannot stand that feeling even then i suggest you learn to get used to it because it will change your listening experience for the better the noise cancellation is stellar as well which this style is famous for a little fyi my ipod nano at half the max volume is my standard volume during school it is loud enough that i cannot hear a thing around me but the music but quiet enough that no one else can hear a peep from my music even in complete silence.if you can stand it too do not bother with earbuds that do not have a hook i will never change back to any style other than in-ear hook earbuds unless i can someday afford high quality headphones for at-home listening these never fall out unless i really tug them and even then i would need to tug them sideways.if anything happens to these i am sure it will not be for a while and i will be sticking with sony in this style anyway.music even in complete silence.if you can stand it too do not bother with earbuds that do not have a hook i will never change back to any style other than in-ear hook earbuds unless i can someday afford high quality headphones for at-home listening these never fall out unless i really tug them and even then i would need to tug them sideways.if anything happens to these i am sure it will not be for a while and i will be sticking with sony in this style anyway,2.0,1.0,5,LS VBD DT JJ NN IN JJ NNS IN WDT VBD JJ TO DT CC RB PRP$ NN VBD PRP RB RB : DT VBD DT JJS FW MD VBN CC FW NN FW RB VBD PRP CC VBD WRB TO VB PRP RB FW VBD TO VB DT NN CC RB VBN IN DT RBS JJ NN IN NNS FW MD VB IN DT NN NN CC FW VBD NNS DT VBD JJ CC DT JJ NN VBN RP IN DT JJ NN DT VBD PRP$ JJ NN RB FW VBD PRP IN PRP$ JJ NN CC PRP$ NN POS NNS WDT VBP JJ RB JJ CC VBG IN DT NN FW VBD FW MD RB VB JJ NN VBZ IN DT NN WDT VBZ RB JJ FW RB VBD IN RB IN DT NN NN RB RBR FW VBD DT NN WRB DT NNS VBD VBG IN PRP RB PRP VBP WRB PRP MD VB TO VB DT NN IN PRP$ NN IN NN IN DT NN TO VB IN RB RB JJ VBZ RP DT NN VBD DT NN RB FW FW IN DT NNS VBD JJ CC VBP VBN VBG NN RB IN PRP$ NN VBZ IN DT NN VBZ RB RB JJ CC FW VBP DT VBZ PRP$ NNS CC FW VBP VBN TO VB IN JJ JJ NN FW VBP DT NN WRB TO VB NNS IN JJ NN IN FW VBD TO NN IN FW VBD DT NN WDT VBD JJ DT VBP JJ IN PRP VBP NNS IN DT PRP MD RB VB RB TO DT NN WDT VBZ IN DT NN FW MD VB PRP NN CC VB PRP RB TO RB VB IN NNS WDT VBP RB VB IN PRP$ NN IN PRP RB MD RB VB IN NN RB RB FW VBP PRP VB TO VB VBN TO PRP IN PRP MD VB PRP$ VBG NN IN DT JJR DT NN NN VBZ JJ RB RB WDT DT NN VBZ JJ IN DT JJ JJ PRP$ NN NN IN PDT DT NN NN VBZ PRP$ JJ NN IN NN PRP VBZ JJ RB IN FW MD RB VB DT NN IN PRP CC DT NN CC JJ RB IN DT NN RB MD VB DT NN IN PRP$ NN RB IN JJ NN PRP MD VB PRP RB VBP RB VB IN NNS WDT VBP RB VB DT NN FW MD RB VB RB TO DT NN JJ IN JJ NN NNS IN FW MD RB VB JJ NN NNS IN JJ VBG DT RB VBP RP IN FW RB NN PRP CC RB RB FW MD VB TO NN PRP JJ NN VBZ TO DT FW VBP JJ PRP MD RB VB IN DT NN CC FW MD VB VBG IN NN IN DT NN JJ RB IN JJ NN PRP MD VB PRP RB VBP RB VB IN NNS WDT VBP RB VB DT NN FW MD RB VB RB TO DT NN JJ IN JJ NN NNS IN FW MD RB VB JJ NN NNS IN JJ VBG DT RB VBP RP IN FW RB NN PRP CC RB RB FW MD VB TO NN PRP JJ NN VBZ TO DT FW VBP JJ PRP MD RB VB IN DT NN CC FW MD VB VBG IN NN IN DT NN RB,553

1740,"went to best buy to buy a new wiimote yesterday and saw this game i bought both came back and install it on my dell dimension nine thousand , two hundred which is about as pre-built as you can get right no vista driver problems for me right wrong two two giraffes wrong first i had to tell my antivirus and spyware software about a billion times to let secure-rom install second i installed it and rebooted third my dvd drive no longer works i am not sure what changed between bioshock and this game cause i bought bioshock and had no problem with secure-rom back then i bought bioshock full price and do not regret a single cent because i actually got to play bioshock i finished bioshock without even cracking it although i eventually did for a second play-through cause who wants to find the dvd everytime right review updated funny thing i never did install dead space again on my system i just cannot risk having securerom on it again since i actually do tons of work on it so here is a review of a cracked version of the game as opposed to the boxed copy which now sits next to other games i do not play anymore poor hl2 i think ea should have an option when you insert the disk that lets you chose between installing their drm version or downloading a cracked one i am joking but i totally am not the game runs nicely on my dell dimension nine thousand , two hundred which ran bioshock and cod four on high just fine if you compare it to pc exclusive titles you can tell the textures in this game is low quality nevertheless it has a nice polished look the controls are fine i tried it with my xbox three hundred and sixty control but just cannot bring myself to play any kind of fps without keyboard mouse the game forces the mouse turn rate so your character cannot magically turn one hundred and eighty degrees in half a second this did not bother me and i actually think it is a nice way to add some realism into the controls the overall experience is effective and addictive if not for the reasonthe developer stated they said it was mostly about psychological fear with help from shadows and music the game is actually mostly about enemies popping out or dropping down from ceilings they said it is about strategic dismemberment it is strategic the first five times by then it is more like habitual dismemberment shoot limbs for maximum damage does not require more iq than boom headshot nevertheless the game just flows very well and lots of little things are put into it to keep you in the game world ninety-nine of the time it is obvious the developers put a lot of thought into the interface and controls it is something new to the genre that future games can learn from so now having played the game i plan on replaying it on easy so i can just wack the enemies to death and then on hard to give myself more of a rush i think it is worth the money however a big part of the reason i think that is cause i played a cracked copy put together by the pirates which installed the game and not secure rom so i am very conflicted about the whole thing i definitely do not want any more secure rom nonsense but at the same time i am happy i bought the game to support more games like this on my pc i guess i will continue to buy games with secure rom if it is good enough like this one or bioshock but i will still be playing the vastly superior pirated copy instead everybody wins i guess at least everybody who is honest enough to buy the game and then smart enough to download a cracked copy too :/",3.0,1.0,17,"VBD TO JJS VB TO VB DT JJ NN NN CC VBD DT NN

1746,first off this phone case is extra slippery i was willing to deal with that since i loved the way it looked when i first bought it the pieces fit together perfectly i had no issues with the gold piece slipping off like i have seen in other reviews it is a bit bulky but i figured that as long as it was protecting my phone i did not care.secondly the recessed buttons take some getting used to i absolutely hated it at first but eventually i was used to it.thirdly when using flash for the camera the case is thick enough that it affects this and gets in the way it is an issue i have had with other phone cases that are too thick that when you take a photo with flash the pic comes out messed up because the case is getting in the way and gives the picture this white layer this minor problem was not a huge deal to me since i rarely use flash for my pictures anyway fourth and what made me annoyed enough to post a review is that the plastic on the left side where the volume buttons are is very thin and fragile i am careful with my phone but the plastic piece on the side somehow broke off and i have only had this case for a couple of months it is a pretty case but i was expecting it to be pretty and more durable since it is not coming from a random completely-unknown cell phone case manufacturer it is disappointing that this case could not last i would not recommend a spigen case especially since i know of other people who bought other models for iphone six phones that broke as well,3.0,1.0,1,RB IN DT NN NN VBZ JJ JJ FW VBD JJ TO VB IN DT IN FW VBD DT NN PRP VBD WRB FW JJ VBD PRP DT NNS VBN RB RB FW VBD DT NNS IN DT NN NN VBG RP IN FW VBP VBN IN JJ NNS PRP VBZ DT NN JJ CC FW VBD IN RB JJ IN PRP VBD VBG PRP$ NN FW VBD RB RB DT JJ NNS VBP DT VBG VBN TO FW RB VBD PRP IN JJ CC RB FW VBD VBN TO RB WRB VBG NN IN DT NN DT NN VBZ JJ RB IN PRP VBZ DT CC VBZ IN DT NN PRP VBZ DT NN FW VBP VBN IN JJ NN NNS WDT VBP RB JJ IN WRB PRP VBP DT NN IN NN DT NN VBZ RP VBN RB IN DT NN VBZ VBG IN DT NN CC VBZ DT NN DT JJ NN DT JJ NN VBD RB DT JJ NN TO PRP IN FW RB VB NN IN PRP$ NNS RB JJ CC WP VBD PRP VBD RB TO VB DT NN VBZ IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN WRB DT NN NNS VBP VBZ RB JJ CC JJ FW VBP JJ IN PRP$ NN CC DT NN NN IN DT NN RB VBD RP CC FW VBP RB VBN DT NN IN DT NN IN NNS PRP VBZ DT RB NN CC FW VBD VBG PRP TO VB RB CC RBR JJ IN PRP VBZ RB VBG IN DT JJ JJ NN NN NN NN PRP VBZ JJ IN DT NN MD RB VB FW MD RB VB DT NN NN RB IN FW VB IN JJ NNS WP VBD JJ NNS IN NN CD NNS WDT VBD RB RB,295

1749,though the learning curve felt a little steep at first it turned out that it was not so bad and now lightroom two has totally changed our workflow for the better previously my wife and i would keep all our photos in dated folders and simply keep groups of edits in finished folders but this always felt kind of clunky and keeping up with and finding particular sooc or finished images could be confusing especially when creating multiple versions of photos it did not take long to learn how to take advantage of lightroom's organizational tools to better keep track of everything and i particularly love the virtual copy feature that allows you to create and easily manage multiple versions all while taking significantly less space than creating real copies of the files we are still learning all the editing capabilities we have not taken the plunge into photoshop cs yet but we are photoshop elements users most of what we used to do in elements is now easier in lightroom it used to take so long to open every photo in elements and make necessary improvements but now we can easily apply certain changes to large groups quickly or even go through one at a time far more quickly than before and for any of the few changes that must be done in elements which so far has just been healing-brush-type work it is just a couple of clicks away to create a virtual copy and open it in elements i think what is both the most daunting and impressive about lightroom is the flexibility there is a huge number of organizational tools provided and there is no one way to organize your photos and your workflow with them especially when you integrate it with other tools this felt a bit overwhelming at first but as you learn about what is available you can really start to develop and tailor your own workflow to fit your preferences and needs there are a few small drawbacks i have had the application crash a few times and some operations are pretty slow particularlyexporting a large number of edited photos which is the main downside to the nondestructive editing scheme however it is getting about time for a new computer so hopefully a newer faster machine will improve the stability and speed,3.0,1.0,2,IN DT NN NN VBD DT JJ JJ IN JJ PRP VBD RP IN PRP VBD RB RB JJ CC RB VBP CD VBZ RB VBN PRP$ NN IN DT JJR RB PRP$ NN CC FW MD VB DT PRP$ NNS IN JJ NNS CC RB VB NNS IN NNS IN VBN NNS CC DT RB VBN NN IN JJ CC VBG RP IN CC VBG JJ NN CC VBD NNS MD VB JJ RB WRB VBG JJ NNS IN NNS PRP VBD RB VB JJ TO VB WRB TO VB NN IN NN POS JJ NNS TO RBR VB NN IN NN CC FW RB VBP DT JJ NN NN WDT VBZ PRP TO VB CC RB VBP JJ NNS DT IN VBG RB JJR NN IN VBG JJ NNS IN DT NNS PRP VBP RB VBG PDT DT NN NNS PRP VBP RB VBN DT NN IN NN NNS RB CC PRP VBP JJ NNS NNS JJS IN WP PRP VBD TO VB IN NNS VBZ RB JJR IN NN PRP VBD TO VB RB RB TO VB DT NN IN NNS CC VB JJ NNS CC RB PRP MD RB VB JJ NNS TO JJ NNS RB CC RB VB IN CD IN DT NN RB RBR RB IN RB CC IN DT IN DT JJ NNS WDT MD VB VBN IN NNS WDT RB RB VBZ RB VBN JJ NN PRP VBZ RB DT NN IN NNS RB TO VB DT JJ NN CC VB PRP IN NNS FW VBP WP VBZ DT DT RBS JJ CC JJ IN NN VBZ DT NN EX VBZ DT JJ NN IN JJ NNS VBN CC EX VBZ DT NN NN TO VB PRP$ NNS CC PRP$ NN IN PRP RB WRB PRP VBP PRP IN JJ NNS DT VBD DT NN JJ IN JJ CC IN PRP VBP IN WP VBZ JJ PRP MD RB VB TO VB CC VB PRP$ JJ NN TO VB PRP$ NNS CC VBZ EX VBP DT JJ JJ NNS FW VBP VBD DT NN NN DT JJ NNS CC DT NNS VBP RB JJ VBG DT JJ NN IN JJ NNS WDT VBZ DT JJ NN TO DT JJ NN NN RB PRP VBZ VBG IN NN IN DT JJ NN RB RB DT JJR RBR NN MD VB DT NN CC NN,390

1755,and really first ice run of my life we got four inches of snow then an hour of thirty-four degree light rain then an immediate drop to twenty degrees everything froze solid an inch of ice covered every surface around this is in south korea for reference i was excited for my first frozen run with my icebugs bought them two weeks ago because i knew this was coming three miles including a four hundred foot high hill that had a nearly half mile downslope that was frozen and poorly lit at five am ice covering eighty-five of everything the few road intersections where it had been heavily salted made up the rest asphalt and nary a slip was had surefooted even confidence inspiring the only part that was treacherous were the solid ice balls up to four in diameter strewn through my poorly lit path stepped on a few of those and tweaked my ankles slightly but even with the reactions to those the pytho 2s never so much as skidded and they handled the asphalt with aplomb just the weird sound of the studs clacking they sounded like suckers on glass being removed quickly or bubble wrap being popped either way great buy the only downside was the insoles which seem thin and really kind of weak i pulled out my brooks ghost insoles and put them in instead perfect fit and they are exceptionally comfortable five stars all around love these things oh and they are water resistant have yet to get so much as damp on me and i have run them through slush and puddles too and look pretty cool on top of it love these shoes,2.0,1.0,1,CC RB JJ NN NN IN PRP$ NN PRP VBD CD NNS IN NN RB DT NN IN CD NN JJ NN RB DT JJ NN TO CD NNS NN VBD JJ DT NN IN NN VBD DT NN IN DT VBZ IN JJ NNS IN NN FW VBD VBN IN PRP$ JJ JJ NN IN PRP$ NNS VBD PRP CD NNS RB IN FW VBD DT VBD VBG CD NNS VBG DT CD CD NN JJ NN WDT VBD DT RB JJ NN NN WDT VBD VBN CC RB VBN IN CD VBP NN VBG CD IN NN DT JJ NN NNS WRB PRP VBD VBN RB VBN VBN RP DT NN NN CC PDT DT NN VBD VBN VBN RB NN JJ DT JJ NN WDT VBD JJ VBD DT JJ NN NNS IN TO CD IN NN VBN IN PRP$ RB VBN NN VBD IN DT JJ IN DT CC VBN PRP$ NNS RB CC RB IN DT NNS TO DT DT NN NNS RB RB JJ IN VBN CC PRP VBD DT NN IN NN RB DT JJ NN IN DT NNS VBG PRP VBD IN NNS IN NN VBG VBN RB CC NN NN VBG VBN DT NN JJ VB DT JJ NN VBD DT NNS WDT VBP JJ CC RB NN IN JJ FW VBD RP PRP$ NNS NN NNS CC VBD PRP IN RB JJ NN CC PRP VBP RB JJ CD NNS DT IN NN DT NNS UH CC PRP VBP NN JJ VBP RB TO VB RB RB IN JJ IN PRP CC FW VBP VBN PRP IN NN CC NNS RB CC VB RB JJ IN NN IN PRP VBP DT NNS,282

1758,i am a huge nikon fan and already own the d70 which is great however i noticed that during the times when i just wanted to snap a quick picture the d70 definitely was not the camera to do it with while it is a phenomenal camera when it comes to really customizing your pictures i do not know if i have ever had a really great picture come out while using it on auto indoors with the flash on my pictures were all washed out with the flash off everything had a red hue i bought a little point-and-shoot hoping to remedy the problem but it was not much better of course the first time i heard of the d40 it was in a nikon commercial talking about giving them to a town ... i visited the website and thought ha yeah right a couple months passed never really thought about it much .. until the other day when i was in best buy and decided to browse the camera section there was the d40 ready and waiting for me to get my hands on it i took a few practice shots in the store and was amazed that the photos actually looked good no washed out look from the flash or red pictures like i would get from the d70 when it was on auto i spent about five days arguing with myself over whether i should spend the five hundred on a camera i practically already had before i went out and bought it the d40 is tiny compared to the size of my d70 and the weight difference is pretty incredible too while it is not a compact point-and-shoot it is not nearly as hefty as most of the dslr's out there all of the practice shots i have taken around my house have looked fantastic even the shot of the pudding snack pack on my desk ;) the only negative thing i have to say about it is that i was hoping the batteries and memory cards would be interchangeable between the forty and the seventy but they are not the batteries are different and the d40 takes an sd card while the seventy takes a compactflash card other than that i am more than pleased with the nikon d40 if you are looking for an incredible camera that can be used as your everyday point-and-shoot yet still give you that optional control over your photos get this one sure it is a little pricey but it is worth every cent,3.0,1.0,12,LS VBP DT JJ NN NN CC RB VB DT NN WDT VBZ JJ RB FW VBD IN IN DT NNS WRB FW RB VBD TO VB DT JJ NN DT NN RB VBD RB DT NN TO VB PRP IN IN PRP VBZ DT JJ NN WRB PRP VBZ TO RB VBG PRP$ NNS FW VBP RB VB IN FW VBP RB VBN DT RB JJ NN VBN RP IN VBG PRP IN NN RB IN DT NN IN PRP$ NNS VBD DT VBN RP IN DT NN IN NN VBD DT JJ NN FW VBD DT JJ NN VBG TO VB DT NN CC PRP VBD RB RB JJR IN NN DT JJ NN FW VBN IN DT NN PRP VBD IN DT JJ JJ VBG IN VBG PRP TO DT NN : FW VBD DT NN CC VBD NN JJ NN DT NN NNS VBD RB RB VBN IN PRP RB .,426

1771,i will say up front that for me this is a high-priced item i am not an audiophile i just want good sound that will fill the room both for tv watching and listening to music after reading reviews i decided to pickup this speaker for use in my finished basement for a few reasons first i have brick walls so running a bunch of speaker wire is not easy and will not look great and second because we do a lot of entertaining in that space and having bluetooth capability makes it easy to play and control music this speaker fits that criteria and i am very pleased with how well it performs.out of the box i was surprised by how solidly built it is i had read the specifications but i have to say i was surprised by the weight it just feels like a quality unit my intent was not to use it as a portable device so it is weight and size does not bother me.from the other comments common concerns with this speaker and probably all single units this size seem to be stereo separation and bass i did not expect amazing stereo separation from a single unit but sitting in front of my tv where this speaker faces i am really impressed at how this nearly does the job of the two bookshelf speakers it replaced which were spaced four apart i have no complaints as far as that is concerned as bass goes i am equally impressed by the lows this puts out very happy about that.for design the thing just looks great i assumed it would look nice but sitting on the shelf it really stands out it goes perfect with our decor and has both a modern and classic feel so i would not hesitate putting it in any room i will take performance first but it is a bonus that it is so attractive to look at.as someone else mentioned the inactivity power off is a bit of a double-edged sword for me truthfully i would like this to happen when i leave the room and forget to power it off and i am glad it does work that way but it would be great if i could auto-activate it back up when using my computer or phone not a huge deal more laziness on my part.overall i am incredibly happy with this unit it is perfect for my need.vate it back up when using my computer or phone not a huge deal more laziness on my part.overall i am incredibly happy with this unit it is perfect for my need,3.0,1.0,2,LS MD VB RP NN WDT IN PRP DT VBZ DT JJ NN FW VBP RB DT NN FW RB VB JJ NN WDT MD VB DT NN DT IN NN VBG CC VBG TO NN IN VBG NNS FW VBD TO NN DT NN IN NN IN PRP$ JJ NN IN DT JJ NNS JJ FW VBP NN NNS RB VBG DT NN IN NN NN VBZ RB JJ CC MD RB VB JJ CC JJ IN PRP VBP DT NN IN JJ IN DT NN CC VBG NN NN VBZ PRP JJ TO VB CC VB NN DT NN VBZ IN NNS CC FW VBP RB JJ IN WRB RB PRP NN IN DT NN FW VBD VBN IN WRB RB VBN PRP VBZ FW VBD VBN DT NNS CC FW VBP TO VB FW VBD VBN IN DT NN PRP RB VBZ IN DT NN NN PRP$ NN VBD RB TO VB PRP IN DT JJ NN IN PRP VBZ NN CC NN VBZ RB VB VB DT JJ NNS JJ NNS IN DT NN CC RB DT JJ NNS DT NN VBP TO VB JJ NN CC NN FW VBD RB VB JJ NN NN IN DT JJ NN CC VBG IN NN IN PRP$ NN WRB DT NN VBZ FW VBP RB JJ IN WRB DT RB VBZ DT NN IN DT CD NN NNS PRP VBD WDT VBD VBN CD RB FW VBP DT NNS IN RB IN DT VBZ VBN IN NN VBZ FW VBP RB VBN IN DT NNS DT VBZ RP RB JJ IN JJ NN DT NN RB VBZ JJ FW VBD PRP MD VB JJ CC VBG IN DT NN PRP RB VBZ IN PRP VBZ JJ IN PRP$ NN CC VBZ CC DT JJ CC JJ NN RB FW MD RB VB VBG PRP IN DT NN FW MD VB NN JJ CC PRP VBZ DT NN IN PRP VBZ RB JJ TO VB NNS NN RB VBD DT NN NN RB VBZ DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN PRP RB FW MD VB DT TO VB WRB FW VBP DT NN CC VB TO NN PRP RP CC FW VBP JJ PRP VBZ VB DT NN CC PRP MD VB JJ IN FW MD VB PRP RB RB WRB VBG PRP$ NN CC NN RB DT JJ NN RBR NN IN PRP$ NN FW VBP RB JJ IN DT NN PRP VBZ JJ IN PRP$ NN PRP RB RB WRB VBG PRP$ NN CC NN RB DT JJ NN RBR NN IN PRP$ NN FW VBP RB JJ IN DT NN PRP VBZ JJ IN PRP$ NN,441

1830,"daft punk is one of my all time favorites their four singles and video series for them were genius and amazing but three stars was probably generous for this cd because it disappointed me a little i am still confused about whether they are treating this as a new album since it was so marketed in the us unlike alive one thousand , nine hundred and ninety-seven if they are it was a dissapointment if it was meant to be a bunch of extended clublike versions of their previous songs then it is alright dont get me wrong the only new songs on the album ouverture and aerodynamite are great and distinct style like discovery daft punk but the club mixes and experimental songs i could do without parts of the club mixes are great but they repeat and run on like an average techno song something i have never known daft punk for the american influence is clear on this album too with the presence of rap on the neptunes remix and slum village both songs are terrible and i try to forget that aerodynamic was destroyed and rap put over it i also have to mention that the romanthony version of one more time is possibly the worst song i ever heard and i am quite surprised its even on the cd with how bad the singing is artists change but this wasnt change it just kinda seemed like they were trying to get you to spend money to top it off i thought i would finally have access to their website only people who buy their cds can go there and when i loaded the cd it took me to a webpage advertising their interstella five hundred and fifty-five figurines forcing me to sign up for some advertising scheme for it kinda disappointed but im trying to tell myself this was just to hold us over for now",2.0,1.0,1,"NN NN VBZ CD IN PRP$ DT NN NNS PRP$ CD NNS CC NN NN IN PRP VBD NN CC JJ CC CD NNS VBD RB JJ IN DT NN IN PRP VBD PRP DT JJ FW VBP RB VBN IN IN PRP VBP VBG DT IN DT JJ NN IN PRP VBD RB VBN IN DT PRP IN JJ CD CD , CD CD CC CD IN PRP VBP PRP VBD DT NN IN PRP VBD VBN TO VB DT NN IN JJ JJ NNS IN PRP$ JJ NNS RB PRP VBZ JJ NN VB PRP JJ DT RB JJ NNS IN DT NN NN CC NN VBP JJ CC JJ NN IN NN NN NN CC DT NN VBZ CC JJ NNS FW MD VB IN NNS IN DT NN VBZ VBP JJ CC PRP VBP CC VBP IN IN DT JJ NN NN NN FW VBP RB VBN NN NN IN DT JJ NN VBZ JJ IN DT NN RB IN DT NN IN NN IN DT NNS NN CC NN NN CC NNS VBP JJ CC FW VBP TO VB DT JJ VBD VBN CC NN VBD IN PRP FW RB VBP TO VB IN DT NN NN IN CD JJR NN VBZ RB DT JJS NN FW RB VBN CC FW VBP RB JJ PRP$ RB IN DT NN IN WRB JJ DT NN VBZ NNS VB CC DT JJ NN PRP RB NN VBD IN PRP VBD VBG TO VB PRP TO VB NN TO VB PRP RP FW VBD FW MD RB VB NN TO PRP$ NN RB NNS WP VBP PRP$ NNS MD VB RB CC WRB FW VBN DT NN PRP VBD PRP TO DT NN VBG PRP$ NN CD CD CC CD NNS VBG PRP TO VB RP IN DT NN NN IN PRP NN JJ CC NN VBG TO VB PRP DT VBD RB TO VB PRP IN IN RB",321

1834,"the teares of the muses the new york university collegium viol consort directed by margaret panofsky with kathleen cantrell and campbell rightmyer sopranos and morwaread farbood organ has just released its cd ein lammlein 17th century german passion music the cd is both very well constructed and very moving in meditations on the death of christ and its significance the viol consort margaret panofsky and caroline marris treble david fenton tenor jeremy brandt-young bass christina brandt-young continuo bass has been in residency at st michael's episcopal church in new york city since two thousand and seven members include both nyu faculty and students and nyu community viol players the central work on the cd ein lammlein geht und tragt die schuld is a lament in five sections on christ's death written by samuel capricornus 1628-1665 for two sopranos viol consort and continuo the opening work o traurigkeit o herzeleid for the same combination is also by capricornus the two pieces were published in one thousand , six hundred and sixty in a volume titled zwey lieder von dem leyden und tode jesu two songs on the suffering and death of jesus the works of capricornus are not well known although according to the article in new grove they are deserving of more study and performance like schutz who praised his work and tunder capricornus often chose to employ the viol consort with his vocal textures he is known to have written theatre music now lost however his gift for expressive detail is evident in the two works presented here the two texts are by different poets the first o traurigkeit was written by friedrich spee von langenfeld 1591-1635 a jesuit priest ein lammlein is by paul gerhardt poet and hymn writer the texts share an exclamatory quality setting off emotional gestures oh great woe oh sweet mouth oh wonder o traurigkeit has a simple structure of eight five-line stanzas with consistent rhyme and meter the opening sinfonia is repeated after the fourth stanza capricornus does not linger over the text after an opening duet each voice has a solo verse delivered almost conversationally in spite of the solemnity of the subject the sorrow of christ's death and the sins of mankind in verse five there is a striking harmonic crunch on the word mourn beklagen ); in verse seven the viol consort is brought in making brief exclamatory exhalations as the body is lowered into the grave with gentle triplets from the singers ein lammlein a longer work has greater variety a basic ten line stanza is established and then disturbed in the first two sections the opening section the longest contains a bit of dramatic action god asks jesus to go forth and bear the sins of his children and christ responds that he is willing to carry the load the second verse o wunderlieb o liebesmacht marvels at christ's sacrifice the two stanzas are shorter the viols again repeat their introductory sinfonia between the two verses and then play in the second verse highlighting the falling gestures of the voices at the pouring forth of the lamb's noble blood the final three sections are a personal response to the sacrifice and love that the crucifixion represents the speaker desires to keep christ as a friend to relinquish the gold of arabia and its spices to be nourished and guided by christ and finally at death to be placed at his side the beautifully bejeweled bride is splendidly bedecked by the full consort of viols these two works each full of interest easily stand by themselves however the cd is enhanced still further with works for viol consort one also with voice by a variety of contemporaneous german composers between each section of the vocal music after the final chord of o traurigkeit the viols enter with a chord of almost identical sonority thus beginning schein's suite no one from banchetto musicale the ensuing instrumental texture viols out from under wraps is further enlivened withornaments on the repeat--trills starting on the note graceful turns and connecting passagi carefully considered and placed are evident throughout the recording and suggestive of a distinctly germanic style after the dialogue between god and jesus the intrad and lamento by david funck provide a brief but likewise dramatic interlude with fast-slow stop-start motion suitably exclamatory the third interlude transcribed from scheidt's organ chorale and variation no five da jesus an dem kreuze stund prepares by its use of chromaticism the fourth interlude tunder's exquisite an wasserflussen babylon the opening phrases of the five viols establish a rich tonal world which the singer enters with another different lament the hanging of the harps on the willow trees the final interlude a small gem from the st matthew passion by johann sebastiani 1622-1683 o welt ich muss dich lassen oh world i must leave you borrows its melody from another famous song of leavetaking innsbruck ich muss dich lassen from the first the singers captivate with expressive open wonderfully blended sound the themes of the recording are complex and interesting and these singers make repeated listening a real pleasure the continuo team is also very fine the bass viol is consistently attentive to the gestures of the music the viol consort functions impressively as a single entity coordinated at repeats and moments of heightened emotion yet each individual voice is clear the liner notes by margaret panofsky are thorough and provide a springboard for further research texts and translations are well laid out and easy to follow although passion music is associated with a specific time of the year the uplifting quality of the music and performance on this cd belongs to a timeless season",3.0,1.0,15,"DT NNS IN

1855,well i have to say that if you are considering a an online rpg then ac is one of the better ones if not the best however there is one very important factor which has forced myself and quite a few other to leave the game the problem was not with the game itself it is as addictive as they come but instead lay with the technical side of the game the first big problem was with the game server downtime ac goes down regualarly for three hours each day this time is as you would guess during the off-peak hours of the day which is great if you live in the us however for international players guess again this was not the problem which caused me to cancel my membership however it was after i switched from a telephone connection to a cable tv connection that i became locked out of the server i spent a good four weeks trying to get any kind of technical support from ac and microsoft my search for help included four chat rooms and over twenty letters sent to two support email addresses i never once met a systems operator who did not reffer me elsewhere nor did i ever get a single reply to the e-mails i sent the bottom line is microsoft will not be able to help you if you have problems they will send you to a seperate ac support center the ac support center exsists but will unfortunately ignore you so if you have worries about system compatibility or a non-telephone internet connection especially through a cable tv line it might be safer to go with everquest or ultima i would have liked to be able to have words with the support team about this but alas could not find one,3.0,1.0,9,RB FW VBP TO VB IN IN PRP VBP VBG DT DT JJ NN RB NN VBZ CD IN DT JJR NNS IN RB DT JJS RB EX VBZ CD RB JJ NN WDT VBZ VBN PRP CC RB DT JJ JJ TO VB DT NN DT NN VBD RB IN DT NN PRP PRP VBZ IN JJ IN PRP VBP CC RB VBD IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN DT JJ JJ NN VBD IN DT NN NN NN NN VBZ RP RB IN CD NNS DT NN DT NN VBZ IN PRP MD VB IN DT CD NNS IN DT NN WDT VBZ JJ IN PRP VBP IN DT PRP RB IN JJ NNS VBP RB DT VBD RB DT NN WDT VBD PRP TO VB PRP$ NN RB PRP VBD IN FW VBN IN DT NN NN TO DT NN NN NN WDT FW VBD VBN IN IN DT NN FW VBD DT JJ CD NNS VBG TO VB DT NN IN JJ NN IN NN CC NN PRP$ NN IN NN VBD CD NN NNS CC IN CD NNS VBN TO CD NN NN NNS FW RB RB VBD DT NNS NN WP VBD RB VB PRP RB CC VBD FW RB VB DT JJ NN TO DT NNS FW VBD DT JJ NN VBZ NN MD RB VB JJ TO VB PRP IN PRP VBP NNS PRP MD VB PRP TO DT JJ NN NN NN DT NN NN NN NNS CC MD RB VB PRP RB IN PRP VBP NNS IN NN NN CC DT JJ NN NN RB IN DT NN NN NN PRP MD VB JJR TO VB IN NN CC FW FW MD VB VBN TO VB JJ TO VB NNS IN DT NN NN IN DT CC UH MD RB VB CD,303

1870,apple needs competition as it stands without any real competition apple will continue to practice their dirty business techniques and hold back features that consumers want need in their products knowing that people will buy them anyway then offer those features next year as new upgrades what am i talking about the camera taking 0.7 megapixel still shots for starters this is absolutely unacceptable for two thousand and ten i know that the ipod's camera is not meant to be a replacement for your digital camera but at 0.7 megapixels it is pretty pointless if you ask me i think they just took the old cameras out of the older ipod nano's and used them the more i think of it the camera upgrades in the new ipod touch are the cameras that should have been introduced last year in the 3rd generation ipod touch there is no reason why apple could not have put in the same five megapixel camera w led flash as they did in the iphone four the only reason they did not to save this feature for next years upgrade oh yeah perhaps because they chose to make the ipod touch 0.07 slimmer than before too because everyone was complaining about how thick the ipod touch was right i am sure if apple would have introduced the new ipod touch 4th generation as being as thick as say the iphone four with the better camera fitting inside nobody would have been complaining that it is too thick second enough of the glossy metal backs apple we are tired of the scratch prone backs it is getting old sure there are tons of cases out there but again if you would have made the new ipod touch follow the design of the new iphone four we would not need to worry about that highly scratch prone backside of course come next years ipod touch update refresh we will see this new design being implemented you will see hear apple say ... we have a brand new design .. completely changing it is looks .. etc next issue why still offer the 8gb 32gb 64gb models that is three straight years now oh yeah because apple does not have any real competition in the ipod market to rival this so they just keep it here until they have to upgrade it to 32gb 64gb 128gb pricing for flash memory of these sizes would not have significantly increase apples costs they could have done it if they wanted to but did not way to think first for your mass amount of consumers apple of course the new ipod touch does have some good new additions that are welcoming thus the reason for two stars not just one upgraded to the new retina display nice touch no complaints there the cheap little front camera for face time again cool nice touch however this is just as beneficial to apple as it is to the consumers apple would love for consumers to use their video chat face time and get more and more people using their products to be able to communicate with their peers think about it iphone four users using face time with ipod touch users and soon the ipad two will have cameras thus face time with those users .. and by then i am sure apple will allow face time to work with their laptops imacs too how perfect for apple .. all of their products will offer face time it is an old strategy but it will work it will sucker users into their little game even though ichat has been around the typical consumer is brainwashed by apples buzzwords and marketing tactics finally and i am almost ashamed to admit this this review is coming from an apple user fan i love apple i love their products but i do not like the little game they play with consumers holding back features now just to introduce them later for their next generations this is dirty business but without any real competition it is what they can afford to do knowing that people will buy their products anyway i for one have held back for years buying an ipod touch first it was because they were not offering enough storage then because there was not a camera now well there is sort of a camera but still it is just not offering all that it should i do not will not buy any product or service that lacks features i want that is the power of being the consumer and trust me i will not cave when i feel that the ipod touch offers all the features i want if i still see value in that product i will buy perhaps next year perhaps but i am sure they will do some similar type of holding back on a feature it would not surprise me time will tell of course if consumers exercised their powers chose not to buy into apple's little game it would force apple to make offer better products for their consumers but that is just asking for way too much from the average consumer they will buy just about anything apple offers and then re-buy it the next year .. and then the next year .. etc sad,0.0,0.0,8,NN VBZ NN IN PRP VBZ IN DT JJ NN NN MD VB

1971,"i was looking for a replacement stereo system for my existing pioneer deh-p six thousand , five hundred which was manufactured in two thousand and two i was worried that the audio quality would be worse since that seems to be the way most other consumer electronics are headed.after powering on the stereo i immediately realized i had nothing to worry about this unit sounds even better than my old one.the clarity of high frequencies is about the same the midrange sound when compared to other units i have tested is still lacking a little bit but this unit thankfully has a bass booster adjuster which helps a little bit and speaking of bass this unit has really hard hitting bass on my two three hundred and fifty watt ten s and it sounds much deeper and more accurate than my old pioneer unit.the built in hd radio sounds crystal clear on my four way sony door and rear deck speakers also i had never actually heard hd radio before and i immediately noticed a difference when compared to a normal fm tuner so i am really pleased with that then again i am probably the only person who even listens to fm anymore.the bluetooth works seamlessly and has great sound quality and works every single time i use it since the very first time i connected it which itself only took about thirty seconds.the display is very good as well viewing angles are some of the best i have seen on an lcd screen and it even looks pretty good in direct sunlight.it s very easy to navigate through the menus in my opinion and thw buttons do not feel as cheap as some other units also the system never lags and there are no delays from pressing buttons or scrolling through the different menus and screens.as far as any negative aspects ... i really cannot think of any they would all be personal opinions anyway.so overall if you are looking for a replacement head unit that has excellent crystal clear sound a nice display and easy-to-navigate menus lool no further pioneer is still runningstrong and when this one eventually does die i plan on buying another pioneer i would recommend this stereo to anyone who is looking for the qualities i have listed above.hope this review helps you out",3.0,1.0,5,"LS VBD VBG IN DT NN NN NN IN PRP$ VBG NN JJ CD CD , CD CD WDT VBD VBN IN CD CD CC CD LS VBD VBN IN DT JJ NN MD VB JJR IN DT VBZ TO VB DT NN RBS JJ NN NNS VBP JJ VBG IN DT NN FW RB VBN FW VBD NN TO VB IN DT NN VBZ RB JJR IN PRP$ JJ JJ NN IN JJ NNS VBZ IN DT JJ DT JJ NN WRB VBN TO JJ NNS FW VBP VBN VBZ RB VBG DT JJ NN CC DT NN RB VBZ DT NN NN NN WDT VBZ DT JJ NN CC NN IN NN DT NN VBZ RB JJ VBG NN IN PRP$ CD CD CD CC CD NN CD NNS CC PRP VBZ JJ JJR CC RBR JJ IN PRP$ JJ NN NN VBN IN NN NN VBZ JJ JJ IN PRP$ CD NN JJ NN CC JJ NN NNS RB FW VBD RB RB VBN NN NN IN CC FW RB VBD DT NN WRB VBN TO DT JJ NN NN RB FW VBP RB VBN IN DT RB RB FW VBP RB DT JJ NN WP RB VBZ TO NN NN NN VBZ RB CC VBZ JJ JJ NN CC VBZ DT JJ NN FW VB PRP IN DT RB JJ NN FW VBN PRP WDT PRP RB VBD RB CD JJ NN VBZ RB JJ RB RB VBG NNS VBP DT IN DT JJS FW VBP VBN IN DT NN NN CC PRP RB VBZ RB JJ IN JJ NN NNS RB JJ TO VB IN DT NNS IN PRP$ NN CC NN NNS VBP RB VB RB JJ IN DT JJ NNS RB DT NN RB VBZ CC EX VBP DT NNS IN VBG NNS CC VBG IN DT JJ NNS CC NNS RB IN DT JJ NNS : FW RB MD RB VB IN DT PRP MD RB VB JJ NNS JJ JJ IN PRP VBP VBG IN DT NN NN NN WDT VBZ JJ NN JJ NN DT JJ NN CC JJ NNS VBP DT JJ NN VBZ RB JJ CC WRB DT CD RB VBZ VB FW NN IN VBG DT NN FW MD VB DT NN TO NN WP VBZ VBG IN DT NNS FW VBP VBN RB DT NN VBZ PRP RP",391

1978,have not you wished that your snes controller did not need a wire i sure did after i used the wavebird wireless controller for gamecube ten years later here is the retro-bit superretro wireless controller here is what i think of it the controller functions as if the snes was designed with a wireless capability control pad works great all of the face buttons work great ... but as other reviewers have said the l and r buttons are a little bit too close to the palm it is not the trigger finger using them it is the center knuckle and that can be a problem on pilot wings as that hair-trigger reaction might take some adjustment to master after all it is no longer the tip of your finger that triggers it but your entire finger but that is a minor thing compared to the freedom wireless provides.other reviewers have said that the controller did not come with synchronizing instructions and therefore i looked specifically for those instructions as i did not remember how they said it worked thank god instructions came with mine i synchronized it then ... my battery petered out bad luck but they were old dying batteries anyway laugh my head off i inserted new batteries and of course it functions as it should do you love the snes as much as i do then modernize it with this controller i would suggest a two-pack though i could not afford it but it saves you a bit of money and the hassle of shipping two separate controllers you will love it oh yes might i suggest you get some energizer aaa rechargables that will save you even more money on batteries,3.0,1.0,6,VB RB PRP VBD IN PRP$ NNS NN VBD RB VB DT NN FW JJ VBD IN FW VBD DT NN JJ NN IN NN CD NNS RB RB VBZ DT NN NN JJ NN RB VBZ WP FW VB IN PRP DT NN VBZ IN IN DT NNS VBD VBN IN DT JJ NN NN NN VBZ JJ DT IN DT NN NNS VBP JJ : CC IN JJ NNS VBP VBD DT NN CC NN NNS VBP DT JJ NN RB JJ TO DT NN PRP VBZ RB DT NN NN VBG PRP PRP VBZ DT NN NN CC IN MD VB DT NN IN NN NNS IN DT JJ NN MD VB DT NN TO NN IN DT PRP VBZ RB RB DT NN IN PRP$ NN IN VBZ PRP CC PRP$ JJ NN CC DT VBZ DT JJ NN VBN TO DT NN JJ NN NNS VBP VBN IN DT NN VBD RB VBN IN VBG NNS CC RB FW VBD RB IN DT NNS IN FW VBD RB VB WRB PRP VBD PRP VBD VB NN NNS VBD IN JJ FW VBD PRP RB : PRP$ NN VBD RP JJ NN CC PRP VBD JJ VBG NNS RB NN PRP$ NN IN FW VBN JJ NNS CC IN NN PRP VBZ IN PRP MD VB PRP VBP DT NNS RB RB IN FW VBP RB VB PRP IN DT NN FW MD VB DT NN IN FW MD RB VB PRP CC PRP VBZ PRP DT NN IN NN CC DT NN IN VBG CD JJ NNS PRP MD VB PRP UH UH MD FW VBP PRP VB DT NN NN NNS WDT MD VB PRP RB JJR NN IN NNS,286

2007,i am not kidding when i say that i have been watching these headphones for a while they have been sitting on my wish list and just recently i decided that i could afford to treat myself a little gift i should not have i just got them today now before i continue to my review i would like to note that when i read other people's reviews i usually discard the opinions of those who have only had a product for a really short amount of time because people usually have not had the product long enough to find the issues that eventually turn up or adequately worked through confusions misunderstandings and hidden tricks i however feel quite strongly that if i do not write this review now while my experience is still fresh i will procrastinate and never get it done.before i open the package i can see that one of the silicone coverings is missing i placed my faith in humanity though and opened the box anyway hoping that it had merely fallen out of its designated slot as i did get them from an amazon warehouse deal nope nada gone fortunately they are not one of the sizes i prefer to wear but this did not leave a fantastic first impression with me i take out the earbuds and admire the look of them they look really nice and i was hoping to get some quality sound from them i was not expecting fantastic sound from them but i was hoping that they would be at least a margin better than decent especially with all of the positive reviews that i have been reading i put them in my ears without connection and i can immediately tell that they do not fit in well this was rather disappointing i have adjusted them multiple times and simply left them in my ears hoping that i would just get used to the feel but they fall out of my ears with even the slightest bump movement or pull i was sitting at the computer listening to youtube music and my left side just falls out so disappointing i even changed the coverings to the smallest sizeand i felt no difference.they are not well noise isolating headphones not unless you decide to blast the music to the point of eardrum damaging and sound leaking i am not an audiophile but i wore them during some sound tests on youtube and i really was not impressed by the quality of sound either maybe this is just because i am used to sony mdr-x five headphones which naturally emphasize the bass but i am not a bass fanatic i want good and clear mid and high tones too.to make matters worse my left side was starting to pop and crackle while i was watching some vlogbrother videos i plugged them in all the way i want my money back discounted price and all so far they are not any better than the cheap 5-10 earbuds that accompany mp3 players which i have worn their only saving grace is that during a 3d sound test they performed quite well it earned them some time for a second chance i am thinking that i will keep them around until tomorrow and see if things do not resolve themselves out i am not a person who easily considers returning products especially if purchased online the hassle is not usually worth it seriously if they do not win me back somehow withing the next twenty-four hrs i am returning them,3.0,1.0,6,LS VBP

2008,i bought this game without having any high expectations for it and we have been pleasantly surprised for kids this is good family fare and it is easy enough for even newer gamers to play think play dates here where sometimes the guest-child has not played but wants to try true it will not take six months to get through the whole thing but there is a lot of value i think in having some games that are challenging yet relaxing and fun as well i like the fact that the kids have to think as they go through the screens since there are various puzzles and projects that have to be completed so they can advance you could blow through the game by doing just the minimum required but my kids enjoyed really exploring the areas to make sure they had not missed anything before they completed the level.note the very first level screen is an aerial dogfight where you have to shoot down four enemy planes to advance the controls are flight-simulator-style toggle up on the controller moves the plane down etc and my kids had difficulty mastering the movement required to get the plane flying right so they could shoot down the enemies they were starting to get a little frustrated so they called in a more experienced pilot dad to finish that one screen so they could go on once they moved onto the next screen they were off,3.0,1.0,1,LS VBD DT NN IN VBG DT JJ NNS IN PRP CC PRP VBP VBN RB VBN IN NNS DT VBZ JJ NN NN CC PRP VBZ JJ RB IN RB JJR NNS TO VB VB NN NNS RB WRB RB DT NN VBZ RB VBN CC VBZ TO VB JJ PRP MD RB VB CD NNS TO VB IN DT JJ NN CC EX VBZ DT NN IN NN FW VB IN VBG DT NNS WDT VBP VBG RB JJ CC NN RB RB FW IN DT NN IN DT NNS VBP TO VB IN PRP VBP IN DT NNS IN EX VBP JJ NNS CC NNS WDT VBP TO VB VBN IN PRP MD VB PRP MD VB IN DT NN IN VBG RB DT NN VBN CC PRP$ NNS VBN RB VBG DT NNS TO VB JJ PRP VBD RB VBN NN IN PRP VBD DT NN DT RB JJ NN NN VBZ DT JJ NN WRB PRP VBP TO VB RP CD NN NNS TO VB DT NNS VBP JJ NN RP IN DT NN VBZ DT NN IN NN CC PRP$ NNS VBD NN VBG DT NN VBN TO VB DT NN VBG NN IN PRP MD VB IN DT NNS PRP VBD VBG TO VB DT JJ JJ IN PRP VBD RP DT RBR JJ NN NN TO VB IN CD NN IN PRP MD VB IN RB PRP VBD IN DT JJ NN PRP VBD RB,243

2020,"to compare this to other units you need to evaluate surge suppression ratings in both joules and amps as well as look at the clamping voltage when you add it all up this is the best protection you can get for the money.this tripp lite unit has a very high surge suppression rating 3,300 joules /8 5,000 amps you will not find many surge protectors with this high a combined rating it also has a one hundred and forty volt clamping voltage this means that it goes into action when the voltage spikes just a little higher than the normal one hundred and twenty volts in your line some units have higher clamping voltages some in the three hundred volt range which means they are not as effective with clamping voltage the lower the better as long as it is above the normal line voltage one hundred and forty volts is ideal you have to go to the tripp lite site to find the clamping voltage specification it also comes in a sturdy metal box which means it will not melt as plastic will if it suffers an energy surge i bought this to protect the refrigerator in my new kitchen if you have a modern built-in kitchen you may not have space between the wall and refrigerator to mount a surge protector i found space behind the slide out garbage bin which is right next to the fridge and drilled a hole in the side wall of the cabinet for the power cords you can probably find some such fix if your set-up is tight it is worth it for the peace of mind",3.0,1.0,0,TO VB DT TO JJ NNS PRP VBP TO VB NN NN NNS IN DT NNS CC NNS RB RB IN NN IN DT VBG NN WRB PRP VBP PRP DT RP DT VBZ DT JJS NN PRP MD VB IN DT NN NN NN NN VBZ DT RB JJ NN NN NN CD NNS : CD CD NNS PRP MD RB VB JJ NN NNS IN DT JJ DT JJ NN PRP RB VBZ DT CD CD CC CD NN VBG NN DT VBZ IN PRP VBZ IN NN WRB DT NN VBZ RB DT RB JJR IN DT JJ CD CD CC CD NNS IN PRP$ NN DT NNS VBP JJR VBG NNS DT IN DT CD CD NN NN WDT VBZ PRP VBP RB RB JJ IN VBG NN DT JJR DT RBR RB RB IN PRP VBZ IN DT JJ NN NN CD CD CC CD NNS VBZ JJ PRP VBP TO VB TO DT NN NN NN TO VB DT VBG NN NN PRP RB VBZ IN DT JJ NN NN WDT VBZ PRP MD RB VB IN NN MD IN PRP VBZ DT NN NN FW VBD DT TO VB DT NN IN PRP$ JJ NN IN PRP VBP DT JJ JJ NN PRP MD RB VB NN IN DT NN CC NN TO VB DT NN NN FW VBN NN IN DT NN IN NN NN WDT VBZ JJ JJ TO DT NN CC VBD DT NN IN DT NN NN IN DT NN IN DT NN NNS PRP MD RB VB DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN VBZ JJ PRP VBZ JJ PRP IN DT NN IN NN,275

2024,like many of my pop and dance cds i bought this for one of my dance classes and i actually listen to it outside of class it is poppy cute and fun and the album has some great cuts here are my reviews of the songs one let us go hip-hop meets an irish jig is the only way to describe this it is really short i wanted more 5/52 c'est la vie this was their first single and the only one that did much in the us it is very catchy most likely you will wake up singing it every other day the lyrics and instruments leave something to be desired but hey it is pop at it is best 5/53 rev it up this song is about a car ride it is actually a lot better than it sounds trust me this is an ok song they could definately have done better though 4/54 to you i belong another single it is a ballad and it is kind of sappy but entertaining at the same time it is got some great harmonies and you can hear the irish influence in the background music 5/55 rollercoaster this is as sugar filled as the album gets lyrics like today's the day we are out to play make this a cheesy classic it was another single from the album it is upbeat and cheery and undeneiably catchy but it lacks substance and maturity 4/56 blame it on the weatherman ummm . . . this is very weird and is one of those tracks where you have to listen to it several times before you start to like it it was their fourth single and a huge hit in europe 3.5 fifty-seven we four girls ok girls this is b witched not korn this song would be awesome recorded by another group but with four twentysomething irish girls with really high voices it sounds kind of strange 2/58 castles in the air this is one of their better slow songs good vocals a pleasant tune definately listenable this might appeal to older listeners more than younger though 5/59 freak out wahoo this is a great danceable track i really love the intro and the voices are just great once again horrible lyrics platorm shoes too high for hip-hop but that just adds to the fun 5/510 like the rose this is b witched being really mature this is a beautiful ballad that can bring tears to anybodies eyes actually i have no clue what it is about but it is still got a beautiful melody and is a nice slow song it is my favorite on the album five five hundred and eleven never giving up this is my second favorite track on the album it is upbeat and sugary without being too childish it is got a great beat and is very danceable it really should have been released 5/512 oh mr.postman um no just read the title 1/5 overall this is a great fun album no matter what age you will not be able to resist b witched's charm it is such a blast to find a band that is one hundred happy instead of a lot of the depressing music played today,3.0,1.0,6,IN JJ IN PRP$ NN CC NN NNS FW VBD DT IN CD IN PRP$ NN NNS CC FW RB VBP TO PRP IN IN NN PRP VBZ JJ JJ CC NN CC DT NN VBZ DT JJ NNS RB VBP PRP$ NNS IN DT NNS CD VB PRP VB NN VBZ DT JJ NN VBZ DT JJ NN TO VB DT PRP VBZ RB JJ FW VBD JJR CD IN NNP VB DT VBD PRP$ JJ JJ CC DT RB CD WDT VBD RB IN DT PRP PRP VBZ RB JJ RBS JJ PRP MD VB RP NN PRP DT JJ NN DT NNS CC NNS VBP NN TO VB VBN CC RB PRP VBZ NN IN PRP VBZ JJS CD NN PRP RP DT NN VBZ IN DT NN NN PRP VBZ RB DT NN JJR IN PRP VBZ NN PRP DT VBZ DT JJ NN PRP MD RB VB VBN JJR IN CD TO PRP FW VBP DT JJ PRP VBZ DT NN CC PRP VBZ NN IN JJ CC JJ IN DT JJ NN PRP VBZ VBD DT JJ NNS CC PRP MD VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN CD JJ DT VBZ IN NN VBN IN DT NN VBZ NNS IN NN POS DT NN PRP VBP IN TO VB VB DT DT JJ JJ PRP VBD DT JJ IN DT NN PRP VBZ JJ CC JJ CC RB JJ CC PRP VBZ NN CC NN CD VBP PRP IN DT NN NN : DT VBZ RB JJ CC VBZ CD IN DT NNS WRB PRP VBP TO VB TO PRP JJ NNS IN PRP VBP TO VB PRP PRP VBD PRP$ JJ JJ CC DT JJ NN IN NN CD CD PRP CD NNS JJ NNS DT VBZ NN VBD RB VB DT NN MD VB JJ VBN IN DT NN CC IN CD JJ JJ NNS IN RB JJ NNS PRP VBZ NN IN JJ CD NNS IN DT NN DT VBZ CD IN PRP$ JJR JJ NNS JJ NNS DT JJ NN RB JJ DT MD VB TO JJR NNS JJR IN JJR IN CD NN IN NN DT VBZ DT JJ JJ NN FW RB VBP DT NN CC DT NNS VBP RB JJ RB RB JJ NNS NN NNS RB JJ IN NN CC DT RB VBZ TO DT NN CD IN DT NN DT VBZ NN VBD VBG RB JJ DT VBZ DT JJ NN WDT MD VB NNS TO NNS NNS RB FW VBP DT NN WP PRP VBZ IN CC PRP VBZ RB VBN DT JJ NN CC VBZ DT JJ JJ NN PRP VBZ PRP$ JJ IN DT NN CD CD CD CC NNS RB VBG RP DT VBZ PRP$ JJ JJ NN IN DT NN PRP VBZ JJ CC JJ IN VBG RB JJ PRP VBZ VBD DT JJ NN CC VBZ RB JJ PRP RB MD VB VBN VBN CD UH FW FW DT RB VB DT NN CD RB DT VBZ DT JJ NN NN DT NN WDT NN PRP MD RB VB JJ TO VB NN VBD POS NN PRP VBZ JJ DT NN TO VB DT NN WDT VBZ CD CD JJ RB IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBD NN,541

2029,i am a veteran of home video editing biz i used several tools before ulead was one of them i bought cyberlink pd delux eight a few weeks ago and made two home dvds of my family vacation dvs with total two hours of playing time from my experience i found there are some very good features with pd compared to ulead it is very intuitive one can almost plug and play without refering users guide there is not one anyway or i did not find one available multiple video audio tracks a lot of cool transfers fancy stuff easy to render and burn dvds the only headache i had was that the software crushes a lot during editing my system is windows vista thirty-two bit 4g ram 1ghz 20g storage space my video card is a little bottle neck with windows 3.4 index rating it is not perfect for video editing of course but no reason for software crush either or at least there should be a waring message telling me that my system is insufficient no such warnings the software just crushes in middle of my project sometimes just after i click on a button it was very frustrating then i did everything i could to free up enough memory and clicking on buttons like stepping in mine field yes you have to click and wait till you see your project name on top changes from xxx.prj to xxx.prj that sign means system is still busy saving or doing data swaping and hint-message under your cursor shows up then you can move you mouse otherwise software will crush right away so you must wait at least two seconds after each click of the mouse the 2nd worst thing is that video footage may get lost and leaves some random black holes in the time line cyberlink tech support said it was because my footages were from ups flash card drive and they do not support that maybe that was it the 3rd worst thing is that cyberlink tech support hotline is not free i did not know that when you have any tech question and want to make a phone call for answer it is like those phone-sex lines youhave to pay for it thirty-eight per month i really do not like it or you can email and get an initial answer and go back and forth from there each eamil answer takes two to three days bottom line is it is a good software and price is reasonable but you got to have to invest a really good desktop pc before you start that can be very expensive,3.0,1.0,7,LS VBP DT NN IN NN NN NN NN FW VBN JJ NNS IN NN VBD CD IN PRP FW VBD JJ NN NN CD DT JJ NNS RB CC VBD CD NN NNS IN PRP$ NN NN NNS IN JJ CD NNS IN VBG NN IN PRP$ NN FW VBN EX VBP DT RB JJ NNS IN NN VBN TO VB PRP VBZ RB JJ NN MD RB VB CC VB IN VBG NNS VB EX VBZ RB CD RB CC FW VBD RB VB CD JJ JJ NN NN VBZ DT NN IN JJ NNS JJ NN JJ TO VB CC VB NNS DT JJ NN FW VBD VBD IN DT NN VBZ DT NN IN NN PRP$ NN VBZ NNS NN CD NN JJ NN CD NN NN NN PRP$ NN NN VBZ DT JJ NN NN IN NNS CD NN NN PRP VBZ RB JJ IN NN NN IN NN CC DT NN IN NN NN CC CC IN JJS EX MD VB DT VBG NN VBG PRP IN PRP$ NN VBZ JJ DT JJ NNS DT NN RB VBZ IN NN IN PRP$ NN RB RB IN FW VBP IN DT NN PRP VBD RB JJ RB FW VBD NN FW MD TO VB RP JJ NN CC VBG IN NNS IN VBG IN JJ NN RB PRP VBP TO VB CC VB IN PRP VBP PRP$ NN NN IN JJ NNS IN NN TO VB DT NN VBZ NN VBZ RB JJ VBG CC VBG NNS NN CC NN IN PRP$ NN VBZ RP RB PRP MD VB PRP NN RB NN MD VB RB RB IN PRP MD VB IN JJS CD NNS IN DT NN IN DT NN DT JJ JJS NN VBZ IN NN NN MD VB VBN CC VBZ DT JJ JJ NNS IN DT NN NN NN NN NN VBD PRP VBD IN PRP$ NNS VBD IN NNS VBP NN NN CC PRP VBP RB VB IN RB DT VBD PRP DT JJ JJS NN VBZ IN JJ NN NN NN VBZ RB JJ FW VBD RB VB IN WRB PRP VBP DT NN NN CC VBP TO VB DT NN NN IN NN PRP VBZ IN DT JJ NNS VBP TO VB IN PRP CD IN NN FW RB VBP RB VB PRP CC PRP MD VB CC VB DT JJ NN CC VB RB CC RB IN EX DT NN NN VBZ CD TO CD NNS JJ NN VBZ PRP VBZ DT JJ NN CC NN VBZ JJ CC PRP VBD TO VB TO VB DT RB JJ NN NN IN PRP VBP IN MD VB RB JJ,441

2052,just got this today from a big box store in portland i have only been using it for four hours i was going to buy from amazon but for some reason the projected delivery time was three weeks from now that was too long for my purposes i did not want to go apple i wanted at least sixteen gb this is 14.1 gb formatted which is not surprising pros it is teeny tiny it may be smaller than some apple ipod nanos minimal controls but the menus seem to be well thought out you attach it and it is just a drive no itunes crapola to deal with i drag and drop mp3 folders with band album titles and pre-named numbered mp3 file and i am good to go i have microsoft windows seven pro computer operating system i get good sound with my sony mdr three hundred headphones cost 22.50 twenty-four ohms impedance one khzsensitivity db one hundred and two db mw is capable of putting out more volume that i can stand cons file copy is fairly slow but once you do inital setup and copy that is not so bad while it will drive my larger 63ohm sony studio cans headphones it does not produce a good sound with them bass on the larger headphones is weak unsatisfying so i am not using those headphones with this was hoping to do so for plane flight travel the eq is fairly limited five band does not have a lot of precision or major change effect yes it does something it is just kind of minimal the instructions for how to actually fully shut this mp3 player down powered off are a bit cryptic they say it goes into standby it may be that it never shuts off in the normal pull the plug no power sense it is do able you put it on pause and then hold down option button for awhile i guess a better way of saying this is the manual is minimal ___ other info charges by usb to mini-usb male connector two hours for full charge built in non-user replaceable battery overall you get a compact system i will report back later on how long a charge lasts and durability note you can supposedly play back pictures and movies with this it does display the mp3 album graphics fairly clearly i did not buy it for video still display cannot speak to that i have put many albums of mp3s on here and still have 4gb of space remaining if you can swing it buy at least a device with at least 16gb pre-formatted storage that gives you enough to cover a lot of moods genres of music without being forced to delete this to make room for that currently listening to moody blues in search of the lost chord it sounds good satisfying i give this a solid four stars at this time of initial impression ___ update 7/22 two thousand and sixteen i eventually moved onto a fiio x3 ii with a sandisk 128gb sdxc micro-flash card that is 2.7 x the cost of this sony unit but for me it was a must do reason i had so many song files i needed a bigger playground the fiio is in a totally different league and should be i will say the sony got me through earlier times at a reasonable expense,3.0,1.0,19,RB VBN DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN IN NN FW VBP RB VBN VBG PRP IN CD NNS FW VBD VBG TO VB IN NN CC IN DT NN DT VBN NN NN VBD CD NNS IN RB DT VBD RB JJ IN PRP$ NNS FW VBD RB VB TO VB NN FW VBD IN JJS CD NN DT VBZ CD NN VBD WDT VBZ RB JJ NNS PRP VBZ JJ JJ PRP MD VB JJR IN DT NN NN NNS JJ NNS CC DT NNS VBP TO VB RB VBN IN PRP VBP PRP CC PRP VBZ RB DT NN DT NNS NN TO VB IN FW NN CC NN NN NNS IN NN NN NNS CC JJ VBD NN NN CC FW VBP JJ TO VB FW VBP JJ NNS CD JJ NN NN NN FW VB JJ NN IN PRP$ NN NN CD CD NNS VBD CD CD NNS NN CD NN NN CD CD CC CD NN NN VBZ JJ IN VBG RP RBR NN WDT FW MD VB NNS VB NN VBZ RB JJ CC RB PRP VBP JJ NN CC NN WDT VBZ RB RB JJ IN PRP MD VB PRP$ JJR CD NN NN NNS NNS PRP VBZ RB VB DT JJ NN IN PRP NN IN DT JJR NNS VBZ JJ JJ RB FW VBP RB VBG DT NNS IN DT VBD VBG TO VB RB IN NN NN VB DT NN VBZ RB JJ CD NN VBZ RB VB DT NN IN NN CC JJ NN NN RB PRP VBZ NN PRP VBZ RB NN IN JJ DT NNS IN WRB TO RB RB VBN DT NN NN IN VBN RP VBP DT NN JJ PRP VBP PRP VBZ IN JJ PRP MD VB IN PRP RB VBZ RP IN DT JJ NN DT NN DT NN NN PRP VBZ VBP JJ PRP VBP PRP IN NN CC RB VB RP NN NN IN RB FW VBP DT JJR NN IN VBG DT VBZ DT NN VBZ JJ CD JJ NN NNS IN NN TO JJ JJ NN CD NNS IN JJ NN VBN IN NN JJ NN JJ PRP VBP DT JJ NN FW MD VB RB RB IN WRB RB DT NN VBZ CC NN VBP PRP MD RB VB RB NNS CC NNS IN DT PRP VBZ VB DT NN NN NNS RB RB FW VBD RB VB PRP IN NN RB VBP MD RB VB TO DT FW VBP VBN JJ NNS IN NNS IN RB CC RB VBP CD IN NN VBG IN PRP MD VB PRP VB IN JJS DT NN IN IN JJS CD JJ NN WDT VBZ PRP RB TO VB DT NN IN NNS NNS IN NN IN VBG VBN TO VB DT TO VB NN IN DT RB VBG TO JJ NNS IN NN IN DT VBN NN PRP VBZ JJ VBG FW VB DT DT JJ CD NNS IN DT NN IN JJ NN CD VBP CD CD CD CC CD FW RB VBD IN DT FW FW LS IN DT NN NN NN JJ NN WDT VBZ CD CC DT NN IN DT NN NN CC IN PRP PRP VBD DT MD VB NN FW VBD RB JJ NN NNS FW VBD DT JJR NN DT NN VBZ IN DT RB JJ NN CC MD VB FW MD VB DT NN VBD PRP IN JJR NNS IN DT JJ NN,572

2077,every wwi flight sim fan has been eagerly awaiting the release of rise of flight earlier named knights of the sky and watching it is progress over the last several years it was expected to be the next great redbaron replacement but what we got instead is a very lean empty feeling simulator that is going to have to add a lot of content to catch up to rb or some other sims much has been covered in the previous comments and i agree with many of the comments good and bad but i will go ahead and add my own list of what immediately strikes me as good and bad or not available yet the best comment was that this is a wip work in progress so just be aware of what you are getting .. and be aware that there is no refund and no way to sell the game dvd down the road or the seven each add on aircraft if you decide you do not like it or get tired of it the on line requirement for single player or multi player is a copy protection system and unless they change things only one buyer is allowed .. so no resale on ebay etc unless they change their policy my general conclusion is that it is inconsistent in all areas so i will comment on the good and bad in each area that i can think of fantastic lighting effects and animated shadows in the cockpit and on objects along with beautiful reflections on water and other reflective surfaces the flight model fm appears to be the best of any flight sims done so far .. it just feels real and comments by fliers of ultra lights and other small planes generally agree it is the best yet the ai artificial inteligence computer pilots seem to be rather docil when fighting and not that well done or not very evasive when shot at .. too easy to shoot down .. the only thing that makes shooting them down hard is the plane you are flying that has this wonderful feeling of bouncing about with every little air currant makes it very hard to aim the cockpits are fully animated with working controls and full 3d .. they are amazing looking but i would like to see a pilot extensions of arms and legs working the stick and pedals as done in some other sims exterior shots show animated pilots and gunners and they add a lot to the feeling of live people in the planes instead of rigid mannequins as in most other sims however the pilots are too small scaled and have been proven to be too small in some forum discussions not a big deal and some still disagree but just one more thing that i feel needs attention dm damage model is excellent with all sorts of plane damage that looks convincing in almost all situations one of the best i have seen terrain is very impressive from high up but scenery objects and textures disappear to close in distance from the player lower down there are impressive looking trees and buildings etc but the colors of much of it look cartoonish with areas of unending prestine grass rivers way to prestine and clean too brightly colored .. the textures are to simplistic if you circle around a tree it rotates to always face you giveing a rather odd look to it over the trenches there is a wonderfull smokey look but the textures are even worse here with continuous non stop craters and at times obvious repeating texture patterns showing along with odd looking grey outlined trenches that look like zippers and other then the explosions going on everywhere there seems to be an empty feeling below that brings up the big problem of this sim it just feels empty like nothing is going on down below if you wander away from the scripted mission triggered event points you do not see anything going on unlike dynamic campaign wwi sims like redbaron or over flanders fields where there are historical events taking place all around you in real time clouds are really well done but very limited in type or looks there are excellent feelings of fog and rain but there are no seasonal terrains yet no snow no frost no spring terrain that is another thingthat will be added later as one of their add ons for free or sound effects are excellent they just seem real and are impressive there are some very well done training exercises with an animated eddie rickenbacker narrating in a very close to real sounding voice figure modeling is good but stilted and not on a par with even older games like mafia plane graphics are beautifully done with full details and many moving working 3d model parts like shutters etc the games interface is beautifully rendered with 3d hangers but very limited in scope and often confusing not well organized and often hard to use like the requirement to leave the game to make adjustments to game settings stick settings etc there is no musical score to add drama to the feeling of the era and very little historical content except for plane information much of the english is poorly translated from the russian which can look silly at times or be hard to decipher so is rise of flight the next great red baron replacement not by a long shot they are going to need to add a lot to get near to that description is it worth buying now absolutely if you want one incredible wwi plane flying experience but with only a few planes and a few plane skins each and very little else to go with it so far i hope people do buy this game and i hope they continue to improve it but it looks like it will be awhile before it feels fully rounded mean while there is over flanders fields which has not received the recognition it deserves and is not widly known about but those who have found it mostly agree it is indeed the currant replacement for red baron created by a group of former early red baron and rb3d mod makers and wwi historians it got undeserved bad forum comments because of it is reliance on the wwii combat flight simulator three game the early phase one and two problems and the requirement to buy it in phase three the payware version three between heaven and hell still relies on having a cfs three game disk available for install but is a vast improvement over the earlier off versions in almost every way the only thing used from cfs three now is the game engine the data base is completely off and seperate from cfs three and there is nothing left of cfs three that is recognizable it has very good flight model though not as good as rof but it is being improved for version four to come out soon and some are going to be surprised it does not have the lighting and reflections of rof but much better varied full seasons with historical weather and terrain textures that are more varied and believable in most cases it has a huge selection of planes to fly including two seaters and thousands of authentic historically researched plane skins a dynamic historical campaign covering the whole war means there is a full feeling of involvement in this simulator with life going on all around you as you fly rise of flight off v3 between heaven hell and another wwi sim called first eagles are all woth buying and playing each having strong points and each a whole lot of

2164,first things first i loved rainbow six and rogue spear i have also played operation flashpoint quite a bit gr is a combination of the three sort of the good the graphics are astounding enough said tutorial is good no bugs on my system.the bad realism is questionable sure the firefights seem real enough with tracers flying and damage and weapons are realistic however since when do green berets go on missions with one rifle and one secondary weapon answer never they go with seventy pounds of gear including rifles backup pistols several grenades and several types of grenades claymore mines night vision knives explosives radios etc etc they carry anywhere from 300-1000 or more rounds of ammo in gr you get one primary weapon e g m16 and one other thing pistol or explosive or binoculars or grenades but only one of these and you cannot mix and match items in the kit you can only choose from certain combinations e g rifleman use the m16 not m4 or mp5 demo guys use the m4 but not m16 etc second the selection of weapons is poor since when is an elite commando limited in his selection of weapons the second single-player mission is a hostage rescue you have got to rescue two guys from two locations about two hundred yards apart so my first thought was to use a silenced mp5 but it is not available even though they are standard weapons for specops soldiers instead you go with the m16 and when you shoot up one location the enemy elsewhere on the map will not even react or put up their guard in any way even though they would have heard the gunshots.third the friendly ai is pretty limited one reviewer called it user-friendly that is true but it is almost too simple and does not provide the flexibility necessary to simulation special operations warfare you cannot control formations stance or rules of engagement and even with the limited control available the soldiers pretty much suck no aitactics no reaction to the enemy no nothing even though they are supposed to be elite commandos.all in all i expected more from tom clancy and red storm this is basically rainbow six or rogue spear transplanted outside and called a tactical shooter combat sim a lot of potential but i will stick to r6 rs for hostage rescue and ofp for combat sim,3.0,1.0,19,RB NNS RB FW VBD NN CD CC JJ NN FW VBP RB VBN NN NN RB DT NN NN VBZ DT NN IN DT CD NN IN DT JJ DT NNS VBP JJ RB VBD NN VBZ JJ DT NNS IN PRP$ NN JJ NN VBZ JJ JJ DT NNS VBP RB RB IN NNS VBG CC NN CC NNS VBP JJ RB IN WRB VBP JJ NNS VBP IN NNS IN CD NN CC CD JJ NN NN RB PRP VBP IN CD NNS IN NN VBG NNS VBP NNS JJ NNS CC JJ NNS IN NNS VBP NNS NN NN NNS NNS NNS FW FW PRP VBP RB IN CD CC JJR NNS IN NN IN NN PRP VBP CD JJ NN SYM NN NN CC CD JJ NN NN CC NN CC NNS CC NNS CC RB CD IN DT CC PRP MD RB VB CC VB NNS IN DT NN PRP MD RB VB IN JJ NNS SYM NN NN VBP DT NN RB NN CC NN NN NNS VBP DT NN CC RB NN FW JJ DT NN IN NNS VBZ JJ IN WRB VBZ DT NN NN VBN IN PRP$ NN IN NNS DT JJ NN NN VBZ DT NN NN PRP VBP VBN TO VB CD NNS IN CD NNS IN CD CD NNS RB RB PRP$ JJ NN VBD TO VB DT VBN NN CC PRP VBZ RB JJ RB IN PRP VBP JJ NNS IN NNS NNS RB PRP VBP IN DT NN CC WRB PRP VBP IN CD NN DT NN RB IN DT NN MD RB RB VB CC VB RP PRP$ NN IN DT NN RB IN PRP MD VB VBN DT NN DT JJ VBP VBZ RB JJ CD NN VBD PRP JJ DT VBZ JJ CC PRP VBZ RB RB JJ CC VBZ RB VB DT NN JJ TO NN JJ NNS NN PRP MD RB VB NNS NN CC NNS IN NN CC RB IN DT JJ NN JJ DT NNS RB RB VB DT NNS DT NN TO DT NN DT NN RB IN PRP VBP VBN TO VB JJ NN IN DT FW VBN RBR IN NN NN CC JJ NN DT VBZ RB NN CD CC JJ NN VBN JJ CC VBD DT JJ NN NN VBP DT NN IN JJ CC FW MD VB TO VB NNS IN NN NN CC NN IN NN NN,403

2304,the best summary of this speaker is “ solid ” both in terms of build quality and sound while it ’ s not audiophile level quality i ’ m pleased with the performance and feature set for the price point.the overall look is very nice it ’ s mostly black with some red accents the grill is metal and has a diamond pattern that stands out well without being flashy the control buttons are all on the top edge and are clearly labeled in red a flap on one the side covers the 3.5 mm input jack and the micro usb input port the other side has a loop to attach a lanyard or clip the body is covered in a rubber-like material that feels nice and offers a matte finish to hide fingerprints there are two large non-slip pads on the base that are very effective in keeping this planted all in all no complaints about the overall design and build quality given the price point.it comes in a decent box with a carry case and a charging cord the manual is very brief but covers the basics which are pretty much self-explanatory it does have voice prompts that tell you “ power on ” and “ pairing ” but they are not as obnoxious as other speakers i ’ ve used with voice prompts still i ’ d prefer a simple beep rather than a voice.bluetooth paring was simple and easy and i like that it enters pairing mode automatically without having to push any buttons i had no problems maintaining a connection at twenty feet.the sound quality is quite good at low to moderate volume levels the high end is pretty crisp the mid range is clear and there is ample bass however it gets pretty harsh when you turn it up although this has a volume range that ’ s wider than you normally get with a bluetooth speaker this is not a speaker that likes to get pushed to the max but in all fairness i ’ ve yet to find a speaker in this price range that maintains good fidelity when maxed out.for the price point about thirty this warrants a 4.5 star rating based on it ’ s performance and feature set i ’ ll round up to five stars since the overall aesthetics black and red appeal to me plus the fact that the buttons are so clearly labeled which is becoming rare on lower-end products well worth considering if you ’ re looking for a easily portable speaker with solid performance sample provided for review a 4.5 star rating based on it ’ s performance and feature set i ’ ll round up to five stars since the overall aesthetics black and red appeal to me plus the fact that the buttons are so clearly labeled which is becoming rare on lower-end products well worth considering if you ’ re looking for a easily portable speaker with solid performance sample provided for review,3.0,1.0,2,DT JJS NN IN DT NN VBZ `` JJ '' CC IN NNS IN VBP NN CC NN IN PRP '' VBZ RB JJ NN NN FW '' NN JJ IN DT NN CC NN NN IN DT NN NN JJ NN VBZ RB JJ PRP '' NNS RB JJ IN DT JJ NNS DT NN VBZ NN CC VBZ DT NN NN WDT VBZ RP RB IN VBG JJ DT NN NNS VBP DT IN DT JJ NN CC VBP RB VBN IN JJ DT NN IN CD DT NN VBZ DT CD NN NN NN CC DT JJ NN NN NN DT JJ NN VBZ DT NN TO VB DT NN CC VB DT NN VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NN WDT VBZ JJ CC VBZ DT NN NN TO VB NNS EX VBP CD JJ JJ NNS IN DT NN WDT VBP RB JJ IN VBG DT VBN DT IN DT DT NNS IN DT JJ NN CC VB NN VBN DT NN NN VBZ IN DT JJ NN IN DT VBP NN CC DT VBG NN DT NN VBZ RB JJ CC VBZ DT NNS WDT VBP RB RB JJ PRP VBZ VB NN VBZ IN VBP PRP `` NN IN '' CC `` NN '' CC PRP VBP RB IN JJ IN JJ NNS FW '' FW VBN IN NN VBZ RB FW '' NN VBP DT JJ NN RB IN DT JJ VBG VBD JJ CC JJ CC FW IN IN PRP VBZ VBG NN RB IN VBG TO VB DT NNS FW VBD DT NNS VBG DT NN IN CD NN JJ NN VBZ RB JJ IN JJ TO JJ NN NNS DT JJ NN VBZ RB JJ DT JJ NN VBZ JJ CC EX VBZ JJ NN RB PRP VBZ RB JJ WRB PRP VBP PRP RP IN DT VBZ DT NN NN WDT '' VBZ JJR IN PRP RB VB IN DT NN NN DT VBZ RB DT NN WDT VBZ TO VB VBN TO DT NN CC IN DT NN FW '' FW RB TO VB DT NN IN DT NN NN WDT VBZ JJ NN WRB VBN IN DT NN NN IN CD DT NNS DT CD NN NN VBN IN PRP '' VBZ NN CC NN NN FW '' NN NN IN TO CD NNS IN DT JJ NNS JJ CC JJ NN TO PRP CC DT NN IN DT NNS VBP RB RB VBN WDT VBZ VBG JJ IN JJ NNS RB JJ VBG IN PRP '' JJ VBG IN DT RB JJ NN IN JJ NN NN VBN IN NN DT CD NN NN VBN IN PRP '' VBZ NN CC NN NN FW '' NN NN IN TO CD NNS IN DT JJ NNS JJ CC JJ NN TO PRP CC DT NN IN DT NNS VBP RB RB VBN WDT VBZ VBG JJ IN JJ NNS RB JJ VBG IN PRP '' JJ VBG IN DT RB JJ NN IN JJ NN NN VBN IN NN,502

2328,not knowing any better we inadvertently purchased a booster seat that you just placed in the seat of the vehicle and then strapped the child in with the vehicle's seat belt what a mistake from the beginning my husband was not real happy with it because of the way the booster seat would move around and the way our son could scoot himself down in the seat and sometimes put the shoulder strap under his arm we never really felt like he was properly seated in it when someone emailed us a video showing the dangers of a booster seat such as ours that is not tethered in like a car seat with a five point harness system we were convinced and immediately purchased this booster seat this booster seat is well worth every penny it may take some work getting it strapped in the seat of the vehicle correctly but once it is in the right way it does not budge and the five-point harness system gives us the peace of knowing that our son is securely in the seat and not able to move around yet at the same time it is very comfortable and he has no problem sleeping in it without his head flopping around we are thrilled with this seat,2.0,1.0,0,RB VBG DT JJR PRP RB VBD DT NN NN IN PRP RB VBD IN DT NN IN DT NN CC RB VBD DT NN IN IN DT NN POS NN NN WDT DT NN IN DT VBG PRP$ NN VBD RB JJ JJ IN PRP IN IN DT NN DT NN NN MD VB RB CC DT NN PRP$ NN MD VB PRP RP IN DT NN CC RB VBD DT NN NN IN PRP$ NN PRP RB RB VBD IN PRP VBD RB VBN IN PRP WRB NN VBD PRP DT NN VBG DT NNS IN DT NN NN JJ IN PRP DT VBZ RB JJ IN IN DT NN NN IN DT CD NN NN NN PRP VBD JJ CC RB VBD DT NN NN DT NN NN VBZ RB JJ DT NN PRP MD VB DT NN VBG PRP VBN IN DT NN IN DT NN RB CC RB PRP VBZ IN DT JJ NN PRP VBZ RB VB CC DT JJ NN NN VBZ PRP DT NN IN VBG IN PRP$ NN VBZ RB IN DT NN CC RB JJ TO VB RB RB IN DT JJ NN PRP VBZ RB JJ CC PRP VBZ DT NN VBG IN PRP IN PRP$ NN VBG IN PRP VBP VBN IN DT NN,215

2472,this game is a far better experience than any cod experiences in the past years where their games have become stale run and shoot experiences the combination of killzones cover system and intelligent enemy ai conveys a sense of military realism and challenge enemy's flank use grenades to flush you out of cover while allowing the player to feel like every kill and battle won was earned through precise positioning and strategy all of which equates to an impressive experience of depth despite the shallow and often times stereotypical narrative speaking of immersion playing this game with the playstation move and sharp shooter is a surreal experience it takes getting use to at first and my suggestion is to practice this scheme in the bot zone which is an offline simulated multi player mode this both allows you to calibrate the move scheme to your liking and at the same time allows you to get acclimated to the pacing and class system of the online multi player which has become my new addiction on its own right after playing through the campaign with a dual shock and than sharp shooter i am now an online fiend in cod if your not up to par with getting a high kill death ratio you are seemingly made useless and target practice by helicopters attack dogs and whatever cod mechanism that unbalances the online experience for us non aiming experts in killzone the class base system allows me to contribute to my team without having to be a terminator in one game i had the highest score dispite having one of the worst kdr of my team i was an engineer and medic taking up points fixing weapons depots and setting up gun turrets which did some killing for me and as a medic getting points healing people left and right when the battles around me became intense which was the norm in ever online match each match was highly competitive and never once made me feel like i could not get involved even with getting slaughtered by a mech which is easy to take down as anengineer fixing the wasp turrets to insure those huge mechs do not become too over powering balanced that is what this entire game feels from the difficulty in the story mode which has challenging ai but gives you powerful guns that never allow the task at hand feel just perfect for online is also a balanced experience with every class acting as checks and balances for each other provoking team success to rely on teams with class diversity and team work along with the best move implementation ever seen in a game just started testing it out online and my kdr is steadily improving as a result ... killzone three is the best fps i have had since the first modern warfare and not once have i even mentioned the obvious ... that this game has dethroned uncharted two and god of war three as the best graphics you can find on the console seriously this game sold my relative who was oblivious to hd not only a new tv but a ps3 as well this game has earned my highest recommendation ... just get it psn poetic 1der,3.0,1.0,0,DT NN VBZ DT RB JJR NN IN DT NN NNS IN DT JJ NNS WRB PRP$ NNS VBP VBN JJ NN CC VB NNS DT NN IN NNS VBP NN CC JJ NN VBP VBZ DT NN IN JJ NN CC NN NN POS JJ NN NNS TO VB PRP IN IN NN IN VBG DT NN TO VB IN DT NN CC NN VBD VBD VBN IN JJ NN CC NN DT IN WDT VBZ TO DT JJ NN IN NN IN DT JJ CC RB NNS JJ NN NN IN NN NN DT NN IN DT NN NN CC JJ NN VBZ DT JJ NN PRP VBZ VBG NN TO IN JJ CC PRP$ NN VBZ TO VB DT NN IN DT NN NN WDT VBZ DT JJ JJ NNS NN NN DT CC VBZ PRP TO VB DT NN NN TO PRP$ NN CC IN DT JJ NN VBZ PRP TO VB VBN TO DT NN CC NN NN IN DT JJ NNS NN WDT VBZ VBN PRP$ JJ NN IN PRP$ JJ NN IN VBG IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN CC IN JJ NN FW VBP RB DT JJ NN IN NN IN PRP$ RB RB TO NN IN VBG DT JJ NN NN NN PRP VBP RB VBN JJ CC NN NN IN NNS NN NNS CC WDT NN NN WDT VBZ DT JJ NN IN PRP JJ VBG NNS IN NN DT NN NN NN VBZ PRP TO VB TO PRP$ NN IN VBG TO VB DT NN IN CD NN FW VBD DT JJS NN NN VBG CD IN DT JJS NN IN PRP$ NN FW VBD DT NN CC NN VBG RP NNS VBG NNS NNS CC VBG RP NN NNS WDT VBD DT NN IN PRP CC IN DT NN VBG NNS NN NNS VBD CC RB WRB DT NNS IN PRP VBD JJ WDT VBD DT NN IN RB JJ NN DT NN VBD RB JJ CC RB RB VBD PRP VB IN FW MD RB VB VBN RB IN VBG VBN IN DT NN WDT VBZ JJ TO VB RP IN NN VBG DT NN NNS TO VB DT JJ NNS VBP RB VB RB IN VBG JJ DT VBZ WP DT JJ NN VBZ IN DT NN IN DT NN NN WDT VBZ JJ VBP CC VBZ PRP JJ NNS WDT RB VBP DT NN IN NN VBP RB JJ IN NN VBZ RB DT JJ NN IN DT NN VBG IN NNS CC NNS IN DT JJ VBG NN NN TO VB IN NNS IN NN NN CC NN NN IN IN DT JJS NN NN RB VBN IN DT NN RB VBD VBG PRP RP NN CC PRP$ NN VBZ RB VBG IN DT NN : NN CD VBZ DT JJS NNS FW VBP VBN IN DT JJ JJ NN CC RB RB VB FW RB VBD DT JJ : IN DT NN VBZ VBN JJ CD CC NN IN NN CD IN DT JJS NNS PRP MD VB IN DT NN RB DT NN VBD PRP$ JJ WP VBD JJ TO VB RB RB DT JJ NN CC DT NN RB RB DT NN VBZ VBN PRP$ JJS NN : RB VB PRP NN JJ NN,543

2546,i was very disappointed with this game the basic idea you play a detective working alongside lenny briscoe and then an ada working alongside the jack's latest assistant is sound but the gameplay is a complete anathema to the tv show in the tv show the detectives follow up blind alleys in their quest for the truth in the game if you follow a blind alley you must immediately load a saved game or you will run out of time or simply lose.in essence much of the early game comprises searching for physical evidence and questioning witnesses while trying to save time the fact that it takes fifteen minutes to bag a cigarette butt is extremely stupid since it means that to collect the right evidence and yet not run out of time you need to play the game over and over to figure out which evidence you need and then go back and psychically only pick up the right evidence needless to say key evidence is carefully obscured by a bad user interface e g a house full of drawers that do not open and one that does but needs to be opened using a key that is in the victim's wallet but itself hidden by the user interface interviewing suspects is even worse whether or not you should ask a given question is totally arbitrary and if you do not ask the right questions your game is over but you will have to figure that out by yourself e g one of the first puzzles in the game involves piecing together a torn up business card just having the pieces with the address phone number or name of the company is not enough what is more there is a witness nearby and the only question worth asking that witness is would you move your vehicle so you can find the last piece of that card.remember if you make a mistake you need to restore from backup so apparently the only good detective or ada is psychic and knows for example that the mineral water has a usable print on it but the cigarette lighter does not sadly you may be psychic but you cannot get lab reports by phone orfax or look up people's addresses in the telephone directory.even worse if for some reason an interview with a witness ends without letting you ask a crucial question you may not be allowed to re-interview that witness even if you uncover evidence contradicting one of their statements i would probably have equally nasty observations to make about the ada portion of the game but i refuse to play it further.finally some quibbles it is not a 3d game everything is pre-rendered so it is a 2d game with pre-rendered video of 3d figures instead of live actors presumably to save money i actually thought that the broadband online demo was considerable better than the game itself with a much less fiddly interface,3.0,1.0,11,LS VBD RB JJ IN DT NN DT JJ NN PRP VBP DT NN VBG IN NN NN CC RB DT NN VBG IN DT NN POS JJS NN VBZ JJ CC DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN TO DT NN NN IN DT NN VBP DT NNS VBP RP JJ NNS IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN IN PRP VBP DT JJ NN PRP MD RB VB DT VBN NN CC PRP MD VB IN IN NN CC RB JJ NN RB IN DT JJ NN VBZ VBG IN JJ NN CC VBG NNS IN VBG TO VB NN DT NN IN PRP VBZ CD NNS TO NN DT NN NN VBZ RB JJ IN PRP VBZ IN TO VB DT JJ NN CC RB RB VB IN IN NN PRP VBP TO VB DT NN IN CC IN TO VB RP WDT NN PRP VBP CC RB VB RB CC RB RB VB RP DT JJ NN NN TO VB JJ NN VBZ RB VBN IN DT JJ NN NN SYM NN DT NN JJ IN NNS WDT VBP RB JJ CC CD WDT VBZ CC VBZ TO VB VBN VBG DT NN WDT VBZ IN DT NN POS NN CC PRP VBN IN DT NN NN VBG NNS VBZ RB JJR IN CC RB PRP MD VB DT VBN NN VBZ RB JJ CC IN PRP VBP RB VB DT JJ NNS PRP$ NN VBZ IN CC PRP MD VB TO VB DT RP IN PRP SYM NN CD IN DT JJ NNS IN DT NN VBZ VBG RB DT VBN RP NN NN RB VBG DT NNS IN DT NN NN NN CC NN IN DT NN VBZ RB RB WP VBZ JJR EX VBZ DT NN JJ CC DT JJ NN JJ VBG IN NN VBZ MD PRP VB PRP$ NN IN PRP MD VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN PRP VBP DT NN PRP VBP TO VB IN NN RB RB DT RB JJ NN CC NN VBZ JJ CC VBZ IN NN IN DT NN NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN PRP CC DT NN JJR VBZ RB RB PRP MD VB JJ CC PRP MD RB VB NN NNS IN NN NN CC VB RP NNS POS NNS IN DT NN NN JJR IN IN DT NN DT NN IN DT NN VBZ IN VBG PRP VB DT JJ NN PRP MD RB VB VBN TO VB DT NN RB IN PRP VBP NN VBG CD IN PRP$ NNS FW MD RB VB RB JJ NNS TO VB IN DT NN NN IN DT NN CC FW VBP TO VB PRP RB DT NNS PRP VBZ RB DT NN NN NN VBZ JJ IN PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN JJ NN IN JJ NNS RB IN JJ NNS RB TO VB NN FW RB VBN IN DT NN NN NN VBD JJ JJR IN DT NN PRP IN DT JJ JJR JJ NN,493

2692,update 11/26 two thousand and thirteen rating increased to three stars after trading a few more emails with taotronics support they realized that the link they originally sent me was not necessary theypointed me to my laptop manufacturer's website ... and told me that the support page there would have the latest bluetoothdrivers.this was not exactly correct there were no updates to the bluetooth drivers on this page but there was an update to the bluetoothmanagement application when i downloaded and installed that update the headset successfully paired and i have been using it withan ip phone application on my laptop so far so go the quality is acceptable and the range seems to be good i was evenable to pair it with a second device droid maxx although i have yet to use it with that device let alone answer calls or switchbetween devices using it with a second device was a bit tricky the document did not help much but i think the basic idea is to paireach device separately with the other bluetooth turned off turn everything off and then turn everything back on again and then wait.eventually both devices found the headset and connected i will update this review again after i use it some more beware win seven driver issues sent a link that wants more money to get the right driver the above rating is temporary until the issue i am having is resolved i just received the headset and tried to pair it with my win seven sixty-four bit laptop after the device was recognized by my bluetooth manager it told me that it need to find and update the drivers for the device so i let windows do that it came back and said that it could not update the driver and to contact the manufacturer so i did they responded within a day and sent me alink supposed pointing to the proper drivers in reality the link pointed to an application called drivertuner which scans the laptop and find all the out-of-date drivers i keep my drivers up to date religiously so this got me suspicious so i selected just the bt driver for the headset and told it to download that it still attempted to download all the out-of-date drivers worse in order to finish the job it told me i had to register this copy of drivertuner which by the way is installed itself as a auto-starting system tray app even though i explicitly unchecked the box telling it to do that during installation even worse still in order to register took me to a webpage asking thirty for the license key at that point i had enough exited the webpage and the app which i had to do twice because it minimized itself to the tray and attempted to uninstall the app even that did not go smoothly i had to hunt down and manually delete all the leftovers the uninstaller could not remove needless to say i ran my virus scanner afterwards i have sent a followup to taotronics asking them to simply send me the necessary driver and told them i did not wish to pay an additional thirty to get this headset working.if they send me the right driver and it installs without further funny business i will update this and review the headset itself otherwise amazon will be getting a return and i will not buy

2712,i guess i have to be the voice of dissent among these positive reviews i have listened to this recording several times now and do not like it nearly as much as samantha's previous release identity she is going way too far down the smooth jazz road with results that are not pleasant the title track opens with this trend a boring and predictable tune that has little to offer the second track poquita has a nice guitar intro but this leads into the most vapid dancey drum machine-driven junk i have heard in some time please no more of this what follows is an assortment of unoriginal tunes until we get to clouds the stand-out song on the cd this and six of the clock are the best songs on the album samantha is at her best singing more traditional cabaret-style songs and clouds is easily one of her best amazing chord progressions and beautiful melodies interlude is lovely as well though far too short wild is also enjoyable with its unusual rhythmic patterns.finally we have tada yet another remix this is of the title track and all it has is more prominent fake drums plus throughout the album samantha has the occasional annoying tendency to sing slightly sharp this is a problem that has plagued all of her recordings and i suspect it has to do with headphone distortion i have experienced this myself many times in the studio it can be remedied by keeping one headphone off so that the ear hears the voice naturally.so basically sam here is some unsolicited advice lose the drum machine please ditch the less-than-inspiring instrumentals unless like interlude you really have something to say and please no more remixes move more toward the excellent cabaret style you have developed in songs like clouds and like a child and watch your tuning,0.0,0.0,1,LS NN FW VBP TO VB DT NN IN NN IN DT JJ NNS FW VBP VBN TO DT VBG JJ NNS RB CC VB RB IN PRP RB RB JJ IN NN POS JJ NN NN PRP VBZ VBG RB RB RB IN DT JJ NN NN IN NNS WDT VBP RB JJ DT NN NN VBZ IN DT NN DT NN CC JJ NN WDT VBZ JJ TO VB DT JJ NN NN VBZ DT JJ NN NN CC DT VBZ IN DT RBS JJ JJ VB JJ NN FW VBP VBN IN DT NN VB DT JJR IN DT WDT VBZ VBZ DT NN IN JJ NNS IN PRP VBP TO NNS DT JJ NN IN DT NN DT CC CD IN DT NN VBP DT JJS NNS IN DT NN NN VBZ IN PRP$ JJS NN RBR JJ JJ NNS CC NNS VBZ RB CD IN PRP$ JJS JJ NN NNS CC JJ NNS NN VBZ JJ RB RB IN RB RB JJ JJ VBZ RB JJ IN PRP$ JJ JJ RB PRP VBP NN RB DT NN DT VBZ IN DT NN NN CC DT PRP VBZ VBZ RBR JJ JJ NNS CC IN DT NN NN VBZ DT JJ JJ NN TO VB RB JJ DT VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ VBN DT IN PRP$ NNS CC FW VB PRP VBZ TO VB IN NN NN FW VBP VBN DT PRP JJ NNS IN DT NN PRP MD VB VBN IN VBG CD NN RB RB IN DT NN VBZ DT NN JJ RB NN RB VBZ DT JJ NN VBP DT VB NN VB NN DT JJ NNS IN IN NN PRP RB VBP NN TO VB CC VB DT JJR NNS VBP RBR IN DT JJ NN NN PRP VBP VBN IN NNS IN NNS CC IN DT NN CC VB PRP$ NN,310

2765,pop trash is probably the best work duran duran has put out to date the blend of melodic lyrics cool rhythms and great synth and guitar work just makes it the must have album of the new millenium ... or any millenium someone else not me is the beautiful ballad with beautiful lyrics and even more beautiful music to back it lava lamp i think is the feel good tune of the album as it makes you just wanna get up and dance playing with uranium is a very cool funky track with a great blend of guitar and synth and i see this as a definate choice for a single hallucinating elvis is probably the funkiest song on the album and it proves a real stong track for the middle of the record starting to remember is a little odd in the beats at times but still a strong track with an interesting ending pop trash movie is a beautiful song and i think it was meant to be a duran song fragment is a beautiful short piece although i wish it went longer mars meets venus and lady xanax are my personal favourites on the album both being songs with great melodies and great lyrics lady xanax has sort of a haunting soung to it as lady ice of so red the rose did kiss goodbye is probably my favourite of the two interludes and again i wish it was a full length song last day on earth is a powerful rocking song to end the album with and i think it should be a possible single as well the bonus someone else not me en espanol was a great treat as i think simon makes it sound great no matter what language he is singing in the cover art and the linear art was great and it makes it fun to look at as well as listen to overall this gets a fifteen out of ten on my scale and goes down as my favourite duran album ... stronger than rio great job duran duran and i hope the next is as good as pop trash,3.0,1.0,2,NN NN VBZ RB DT JJS NN NN NN VBZ VBN RP TO VB DT VB IN JJ NNS VBP NNS CC JJ JJ CC NN NN RB VBZ PRP DT MD VB NN IN DT JJ NN : CC DT NN NN RB RB PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN JJ NNS CC RB RBR JJ NN TO VB PRP NN NN FW VBP VBZ DT NN JJ NN IN DT NN IN PRP VBZ PRP RB VBP TO VB RB CC VB VBG IN NN VBZ DT RB JJ JJ NN IN DT JJ VB IN NN CC NN CC FW VB DT IN DT JJ NN IN DT JJ JJ NN VBZ RB DT JJS NN IN DT NN CC PRP VBZ DT JJ JJ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN VBG TO VB VBZ DT JJ JJ IN DT NNS IN NNS CC RB DT JJ NN IN DT JJ VBG NN NN NN VBZ DT JJ NN CC FW VBP PRP VBD VBN TO VB DT JJ NN NN VBZ DT JJ JJ NN IN FW NN PRP VBD JJR NNS VBZ NN CC NN NN VBP PRP$ JJ NNS IN DT NN CC VBG NNS IN JJ NNS CC JJ NNS NN NN VBZ NN IN DT NN NN TO PRP IN NN NN IN RB JJ DT NN VBD NN NN VBZ RB PRP$ NN IN DT CD NNS CC RB FW NN PRP VBD DT JJ NN NN JJ NN IN NN VBZ DT JJ VBG NN TO VB DT NN IN CC FW VBP PRP MD VB DT JJ JJ RB RB DT NN NN RB RB PRP IN NN VBD DT JJ NN IN FW VBP NNS VBZ PRP JJ JJ DT NN WDT NN PRP VBZ NN IN DT NN NN CC DT JJ NN VBD JJ CC PRP VBZ PRP NN TO VB IN RB RB IN VB TO RB DT VBZ DT CD IN IN CD IN PRP$ NN CC VBZ RP IN PRP$ JJ NN NN : JJR IN FW JJ NN NN NN CC FW VBP DT JJ VBZ RB JJ IN NN NN,359

2771,i just got back from a three week trip to st petersburg stockholm copenhagen and paris lots of airports train stations and cobble stone streets i researched for weeks the best luggage to fit the dimension restrictions by the euro and american airlines had the best durability and light weight in order to fill my case for the long haul i chose the teal color to easily stand out and the in-line skate wheel design over the spinner wheels that may not hold up to hazards outside an airport i made the right choice it is the only light suitcase that has total rigid support around all the sides of the case the stand support on the bottom doubles as a handle to lift the handle opens smoothly and worked perfectly the outer pockets are very handy inner mesh can keep dirty clothes separated.the only negatives that are minor and why i did not give five stars the fabric is polyester and will get scuffs i scotchgaurded the fabric and it helped remove the dirt but if you plan to travel al lot then get a ballistic nylon case the fabric is not waterproof the wheel housing is installed with all screws except one rivet so not easily replaced i wish there was a plastic kickplate on the underside instead of a vinyl strip.this case for the money especially the close out price is a bargain i travel a few times a year and expect this set to last for several years by far the best out there for the price,3.0,1.0,0,LS RB VBD RB IN DT CD NN NN TO VB NN NN NN CC NN NNS IN NNS NN NNS CC JJ NN NNS FW VBN IN NNS DT JJS NN TO VB DT NN NNS IN DT NN CC NN NNS VBD DT JJS NN CC JJ NN IN NN TO VB PRP$ NN IN DT JJ NN FW VBD DT NN NN TO RB VB RP CC DT JJ NN NN NN IN DT NN NNS WDT MD RB VB RP TO NNS IN DT NN FW VBD DT JJ NN PRP VBZ DT JJ NN NN WDT VBZ JJ JJ NN IN DT DT NNS IN DT NN DT NN NN IN DT JJ VBZ IN DT VBP TO VB DT VB VBZ RB CC VBD RB DT JJ NNS VBP RB JJ JJ NN MD VB JJ NNS VBP RB NNS WDT VBP JJ CC WRB FW VBD RB VB CD NNS DT NN VBZ NN CC MD VB NNS LS VBD DT NN CC PRP VBD VB DT NN CC IN PRP VBP TO VB NNP NN RB VB DT JJ NN NN DT NN VBZ RB JJ DT NN NN VBZ VBN IN DT NNS IN CD NN RB RB RB VBN FW NN EX VBD DT JJ NN IN DT NN RB IN DT NN VBZ NN IN DT NN RB DT NN IN NN VBZ DT NN FW VB DT JJ NNS DT NN CC VB DT VBN TO VB IN JJ NNS IN RB DT JJS IN RB IN DT NN,261

2777,i am a veteran of inspiration having bought my first copy from the program's then husband-and-wife creators and one of their dads at a computer trade show long ago i have stuck with the program because it offers a quick way to do mind maps particularly rapid-fire an outliner and presentation creator in one simple very efficient and generally bug-free package over the years the company has focused its attention primarily on the k twelve market it seems a natural fit though i think the company could have achieved some degree of success in the commercial market as well however their marketing wisdom may be right the competition for mind mapping software in the commercial marketplace is fierce and there are a couple of microsoft products in this space as well so inspiration ticks on and delivers a very nice product a reasonable price you can put together a simple graphic linked outline or mind map with less than a minute's instruction if that the program comes with a large library of illustrations and symbols you can switch quickly and easily from the graphical view to a traditional outliner view a feature which i find very useful finally you can create reasonably nifty presentations with inspiration as well though i do not use it for this purpose overall if you like having a simple to use but very flexible tool immediately for visual or traditional outlining inspiration is the little wonder that your schoolkid may know about but you do not it is a great little product.jerry,3.0,1.0,1,LS VBP DT NN IN NN VBG VBN PRP$ JJ NN IN DT NN POS RB JJ NNS CC CD IN PRP$ NNS IN DT NN NN VBP RB RB FW VBP VBN IN DT NN IN PRP VBZ DT JJ NN TO VB VB NNS RB JJ DT NN CC NN NN IN CD JJ RB JJ CC RB JJ NN IN DT NNS DT NN VBZ VBN PRP$ NN RB IN DT NN CD NN PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN FW VBP DT NN MD VB VBN DT NN IN NN IN DT JJ NN RB RB RB PRP$ NN NN MD VB RB DT NN IN NN NN NN IN DT JJ NN VBZ JJ CC EX VBP DT NN IN NN NNS IN DT NN RB RB IN NN VBZ IN CC VBZ DT RB JJ NN DT JJ NN PRP MD VB RB DT JJ JJ VBN NN CC NN NN IN JJR IN DT NN POS NN IN IN DT NN VBZ IN DT JJ NN IN NNS CC NNS PRP MD VB RB CC RB IN DT JJ NN TO DT JJ NN VBP DT NN WDT FW VB RB JJ RB PRP MD VB RB JJ NNS IN NN RB RB IN FW VBP RB VB PRP IN DT NN RB IN PRP IN VBG DT JJ TO VB CC RB JJ NN RB IN JJ CC JJ VBG NN VBZ DT JJ NN WDT PRP$ NN MD VB IN CC PRP VBP RB PRP VBZ DT JJ JJ NN,257

2779,background i have two intel macs with aluminum and glass cases one a non-unibody twenty-four inch imac another a unibody 13.3- inch macbook pro they both have core two duo processors and so would not run mac os x 10.7 to a decent level of capability then i heard how apple was going to deprecate the mobileme that i willingly paid one hundred and eighty for so it could stay around for two years now apple is going to throw not just that pittance but the money i spent on three intel macs and a time capsule that did what i wanted to over three thousand out the window so i struck back and keep snow leopard configured in a pleasing manner i am smart about what i do on the internet and like the level of functionality i currently have and decided to supplement my snow leopard with windows seven what version of windows seven deserves to go on an intel mac for me the answer was simple the same version as what i have in snow leopard-not a single missing feature but not installed with objectionable updates which i do not want the mac app store and i do not want a windows app store either so i run windows seven ultimate on my two intel macs with the internet explorer nine and windows seven sp1 hidden and they will stay so as long as absolutely possible with that said here are my opinions of the various features one the new taskbar it kicks butt i had to download the windows seven rc over a 1.5 mbit dsl connection just to experience the new taskbar early and when i got opportunities i bought windows seven that so fat has been fully legal to avoid hassles and yes i know windows seven has windows genuine advantage but if that is going to be an issue i expect that microsoft will inform me of what to do about it the one problem i had was successfully dealt with and they answered another question most kindly my experience has been top notch probably because god gives me better luck i actually pray about things like this and so far god has not failed me two homegroup when all three windows seven computers are on and awake homegroup works perfectly for me i am most pleased with its performance three windows xp mode all three computers have an edition of windows seven that allows it although one does not support virtualization and the unassisted virtualization updater refuses to believe it is needed i use it for microsoft sam and will not be afraid to load applications into windows xp mode should i need them the 13.3- inch core two duo macbook pro has more audio garbling than the imac does the imac has almost none three bitlocker drive encryption i found one nice fellow who posted directions on a way to make bitlocker work without a tpm 1.2 or better chip and it allows me to have access to every feature i paid for i am most pleased with windows seven in that regard four language packs it helps having a laptop and desktop that if i need to can switch languages so i can help people who may need it i have not needed it so far five the geek factor i must say windows seven ultimate gives me great pride that i can have access to not just the basic set of features in home premium but that if someone has a problem with windows seven professional enterprise or ultimate i can help them the features that are also in windows seven professional which i have on an old intel cantrino santa rosa mobile technology former vista laptop that was bought well before the offer to get a free windows seven upgrade but that i used my student thirty offer for-i paid more to get extended download time and a dvd backup plus i got the thirty-two bit version which did not have the installation nightmare of the sixty-four bit version are also so good to have in the toolbox of available windows seven features i love out of the windows seven professional level features network aware printing i go to my aunt and uncle's ginormous house every now and then and my windows seven professional laptop and to be fair my windows seven ultimate macbook pro now too can simply go from the color and black and white laser printers here to my aunt anduncle's officejer j4580 and back again windows seven hoem premium is too little for my dual-cre windows seven computers although i will put it on my emachine-a w3622 with a single core celeron four hundred and twenty at 1.6 ghz and intel gma nine hundred and fifty barely aero-capable graphics plus i can have people who are having windows seven issues send to me for remote assistance and pull their computer up on my imac which has a big enough screen to help most people especially if they have laptops and i can if the problem is not fixable under remote assistance take my macbook pro and have a point of comparison on-site with me especially since i got windows seven from good to great discounts through ebay for windows seven ultimate and microsoft's student offer for windoes seven professional i feel like i got everything i needed for plenty fair enough prices i love the way three or more windows seven computers work with each other i truly do love it i guess i better end this review before i take an eternity plus i saw a commercial on tv that ran a fair amount last year showiing a computer at one person's home being accessed by a laptop that someone let them borrow the remote computer was displaying an aero desktop on the laptop windows vista even ultimate to the best of my knowledge could not do this so i investigated and after months of not knowing i found out that windows seven ultimate with the experience section maxed could do it but professional could not if you love the aero eye candy and especially love windows seven s improvements to it from vista that every bit as much as bitlocker and bitlocker to go or the language packs provided free make windows seven ultimate worth the money over even professional provided your hardware can give you something at least approaching an optimal experience in other words a bloomfield lynnfield clarksdale or arrandale or their sandy bridge successors for those who like them cpus or a core two duo quad or extreme with dedicated or nvidia integrated graphics will be just about perfect for windows seven ultimate and if it can have 5ghz 802.11 n wifi and bluetooth 2.1+ edr or better along with gigabit ethernet and maybe a tpm 1.2 or better chip as well then that is all the better but anyway especially with worthy hardware windows seven ultimate is worth the expense in this user's eye because he has hardware that can come remarkably close to being perfect for windows seven ultimate go microsoft for windows seven you made excellent choices in all but two areas of the windows seven experience windows eight however is as tough a sale as vista was but fora different reason because i do not want my desktop os even on a netbook to be the same as my mobile os and lion faces similar roadblocks from snow leopard update 1-17- two thousand and thirteen i will be updating all of the reviews for all of the windows seven installers i have on tap to reflect a certain difference betweem me and the average reviewer i to date have done all of my installs whether of ultimate full purchase product ultimate upgrade professional upgrade through the windows seven student offer home premium upgrade or home premium upgrade family pack through the clean install method and it never fails to grab all of the updates update to sp1 and then grab the missing post-sp one updates i therefore believe that the people who cannot fully update windows did not do the clean install method and while i do not blame them i do not have the time personally for a system that behaves strangely because windows vista was trying to be transmuted into windows seven when it is hard enough for one service pack of windows seven to be successfully transmuted into another i hope that if you are blaming windows seven for your issues when upgrading from vista that this advice can be of use update 11-21- two thousand and thirteen i since set it up with a third computer in a dell optiplex seven hundred and forty-five so i could experience what it is like on a real pc where it dual boots with xp professional from dell oem installer media asidefrom requiring a custom sound driver for the sound card to support the internal speaker that it has spent all the money on windows seven so now i cannot afford speakers that work it worked perfectly out of the box unfortunately after windows eight hit general availability windows eight gets media center that supports internet tv while that feature was removed from windows seven at microsoft's behest to push eight after finding windows eight does not like to dual-boot with windows seven on hardware that supports uefi i have one of the rare windows seven pcs to support uefi bought a month before windows eight general availability i am now looking at having to sit there and remove my windows seven hard disk to install eight and then manually put the windows seven hard disk back in and pray windows eight has not overwritten my default bios settings that are compatible i want media center to work on windows seven since this is a three hundred and twenty fully legal piece of software when used on computers it was officially activated with on windows seven home premium i really do not care but on windows seven ultimate i want media center and would gladly give up on internet explorer eleven and support of consumer versions to two thousand and twenty windows nine had better be better than eight and as good as seven if not i will buy a used macbook or pro with lion to replace the macbook pro whose fan overstressed so bad that i had to trade it at a loss applecare would not support it if it was not fully up-to-date and i did not want to update to lion that soon given the problem-prone nvidia graphics my older model macbook pro had the seven hundred and forty-five and a pc laptop i bought an upgrade copy of windows seven ultimate for that originally ran home premium vista both work so well but i insist on media center getting full support because with the bad things i have heard on windows eight and even suprisingly bad things for windows 8.1 i want to use windows seven ultimate long after it is internet browsing ability except to activate is gone that is just a rant from someone far too satisfied with windows seven for their own good or so the windows eight fanboys would say i consider myself a windows eight hater because microsoft did not make the right moves as regards windows eight end update 11-21- two thousand and thirteen update 2-3- two thousand and fourteen windows seven is a good os for those people who do not want a mac but do not want windows eight either it does do classic appearance differently from windows vista and earlier instead using the square buttons even in classic appearance but that is ok because i dreamed of an os with this functionality in the taskbar since windows ninety-five and the redesigned taskbar is even in windows seven home premium sure you may lose some of the features in the ultimate edition but you get everything you absolutely have to have-although windows seven anytime upgrade is no longer available to windows seven users so buying the right edition of windows seven is extra-crucial if you buy windows seven home premium and later find out you need xp mode you are going to have to sell your copy of home premium assuming you are using the retail copy and replace it with a retail copy of ultimate or professional windows xp may have been great in two thousand and one but windows seven is as close to xp as you can make vista-and has proven worthwhile ever since two thousand and nine for further proof look at how microsoft released internet explorer ten and eleven for windows seven they sure did not have to do that but they realized windows seven was still popular so popular i have seven copies of it including a family pack of home premium and so they released as many of their updated components as they could for windows seven without totally making windows 8/ 8.1 a non-issue end update 2-3- two thousand and fourteen update 2-27- two thousand and fourteen i was busy trying to do research to determine whether i should run windows eight on a late production windows seven pc or whether it would be a more productive use of the second hard drive in this pc to backup the system configuration and image of this copy of windows seven as well as my copy of windows seven professional upgrade and windows seven ultimate upgrade that had sp1 included well i sat there and started the backup to this other pc which had received a clean install of windows seven home premium family pack upgrade and office two thousand and three student and teacher edition and it was so easy i knew my money spent on high-end copies of windows seven rather than buying a windows home server which that os later was discontinued was oh so worth it a similar update will be on windows seven ultimate upgrade and windows seven professional upgrade end update 2-27- two thousand and fourteen update 9-16- two thousand and fourteen critical windows nine status update ): when that imac that had the full install copy bit the bullet the superdrive ruined the boot camp installer it is too old to use a thumb drive to load boot camp drivers let alone windows seven i had to find some other way to use windows seven ultimate thankfully by setting aside a spare cd-key of windows seven home premium that and the pc it went on was originally designed to allow the imac to backup before the imac's unreliability in windows seven ultimate torpedoed that option specifically an rtm product install rather than sp1 i was able to finally transfer windows seven ultimate from the imac to the formerly spare pc now i have got windows seven ultimate up and running with office two thousand and seven and do not miss a single thing why did i do this well consider what i uncovered about the supposedly awesome windows nine that is supposed to replace seven i also heard that windows nine may look like windows seven but this mini-start menu based on a microsoft press photo has live tiles where links to local computer items once stood in seven plus aero is still out for lunch defenders say skeumorphism is dead i say long live skeumorphism and microsoft ties your activation to the windows store so that means that they have a much more swift and sure means of sending your computer into reduced functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key i want my computer being rendered illegal for a good reason at least not for something trivial like windows nine allows for not because i did not buy enough apps from the windows store in a given day week month or year how are you supposed to use the metro-limited windows nine when not using metro apps early and often could be grounds for your computer to be rendered illegal according to microsoft in effect they have made metro mandatory and inaccessible rather than optional from the ability to legally use windows point of view not from the it is in your face while you are using it point of view and far too readily accessible i would rather have a minor bug as critical as the bug in question may be to the use of the computer in the form of bad ui than a horrible show-stopping bug that makes windows eight s ui crimes awful as they might have been seem minor i love that they are bringing back the start button but what they really needed to do was scrap the windows store and modern apps not make your computer depend on them but be unable to use them because it is a desktop known as win thirty-two sku i am sticking with windows seven and as soon as it is toast no more internet for me i would suggest you do the same end update 9-16- two thousand and fourteen critical windows nine status update,2.0,1.0,47,NN FW VBP CD JJ NNS IN NN CC NN NNS CD DT JJ CD NN NN DT DT JJ CD : NN NN FW PRP DT

2811,"first of all i got lucky on the price of this unit amazon warehouse deals had one for about sixty less than the usual retail price and the only flaw was a tiny ding in the plastic of the ipod dock that comes with the ar30 otherwise this is a completely new unit and functions flawlessly i bought the complete sonata component system ar30 dv30 cd30 and np30 to replace my fifteen year old jvc f3000 compact stereo system a gem of a mini-system which i finally had to retire due to the cd player and tape deck no longer performing reliably i have a relatively short wall and a small entertainment console where my stereo system sits so the small footprint of the sonata components is a necessity for me i love the brushed aluminum silver cases to me this is classier looking than the typical black that most component manufacturers stick with but that is just cosmetic and everyone's taste is different ca also made the sonata system in black made because the sonata components are no longer part of ca's current line in terms of performance i am very happy with the ease of use sound quality and functionality of the ar30 and the other sonata components from a cold start the ar30 is a tad slow -8.4 seconds from clicking the remote on to ready-to-play--but not enough to complain about with 40w per channel at eight ohms it is more than enough to drive my klipsch rb sixty-one ii speakers the volume control maxes out at a setting of thirty-nine and i have never had it over twenty-five so unless you like busting your eardrums you will be fine.each component in the sonata system comes with its own remote and they are all interoperable there are dedicated buttons at the base of the remote for selecting which component to control the dvd remote has the biggest array of buttons and is a little heavier than the receiver or cd remotes all the components have simple clear arrays of buttons on their front panels the receiver controls are basic--there's no graphic equalizer for example just bass treble and balance--but i have not found this to be a drawback since the sound quality is crystal pure the receiver has a separate in out for a subwoofer the input comes from the dvd player and works fine with my polk ps10.the sonata line has been discontinued by ca and has not been replaced by a similar small footprint model the sonata is only 270mm wide whereas the ca topaz and azur current lines are full-sized at 430mm wide so if you are in the market for a compact component system grab one of these now before current retail inventories disappear i bought three of the four components from amazon two new one barely used and i got the np30 used six mos old on ebay with careful shopping i paid just 1,008 for everything shipping included if money is no object in your pursuit of perfect audio then you can indulge in higher-end components than the sonata but if you are on a budget or if you need a second system for a rec room etc the sonata delivers terrific sound at a great price",3.0,1.0,19,RB IN DT FW VBD JJ IN DT NN IN DT NN NN NN NNS VBD CD IN RB CD JJR IN DT JJ JJ NN CC DT JJ NN VBD DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN NN WDT VBZ IN DT NN RB DT VBZ DT RB JJ NN CC VBZ RB FW VBD DT JJ NN NN NN CD NN NN CC NN TO VB PRP$ CD NN JJ NN NN JJ NN NN DT NN IN DT NN WDT FW RB VBD TO VB JJ TO DT NN NN CC NN NN RB RB VBG RB FW VBP DT RB JJ NN CC DT JJ NN NN WRB PRP$ NN NN VBZ IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN NNS VBZ DT NN IN PRP FW VBP DT VBN NN NN NNS TO PRP DT VBZ JJR VBG IN DT JJ JJ IN JJS NN NNS VBP IN CC DT VBZ RB JJ CC NN POS NN VBZ JJ MD RB VBD DT NN NN IN JJ VBN IN DT NN NNS VBP RB RBR NN IN MD POS JJ NN IN NNS IN NN FW VBP RB JJ IN DT NN IN NN JJ NN CC NN IN DT NN CC DT JJ NN NNS IN DT JJ NN DT NN VBZ DT NN JJ CD NNS IN VBG DT JJ IN TO JJ : CC RB JJ TO VB IN IN CD IN NN IN CD NNS PRP VBZ RBR IN JJ TO VB PRP$ NN NN CD LS NNS DT NN NN VBZ RP IN DT NN IN CD CC FW VBP RB VBN PRP IN CD RB IN PRP IN VBG PRP$ NNS PRP MD VB JJ NN IN DT NN NN VBZ IN PRP$ JJ JJ CC PRP VBP DT JJ EX VBP JJ NNS IN DT NN IN DT JJ IN VBG WDT NN TO VB DT NN JJ VBZ DT JJS NN IN NNS CC VBZ DT JJ JJR IN DT NN CC NN NNS PDT DT NNS VBP JJ JJ NNS IN NNS IN PRP$ JJ NNS DT NN NNS VBP JJ : EX VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN RB NN NN CC NN : CC FW VBP RB VBN DT TO VB DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBZ JJ JJ DT NN VBZ DT JJ IN IN IN DT NN DT NN VBZ IN DT NN NN CC VBZ JJ IN PRP$ NN NN NN NN VBZ VBN VBN IN MD CC VBZ RB VBN VBN IN DT JJ JJ NN NN DT NN VBZ RB CD NN JJ IN DT MD NN CC NN JJ NNS VBP JJ IN CD NN JJ RB IN PRP VBP IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN VB CD IN DT RB IN JJ JJ NNS VBP FW VBD CD IN DT CD NNS IN NN CD JJ CD RB VBN CC FW VBD DT NN VBN CD NNS JJ IN NN IN JJ NN FW VBN RB CD IN NN NN VBD IN NN VBZ DT NN IN PRP$ NN IN JJ NN RB PRP MD VB IN JJ NNS IN DT NN CC IN PRP VBP IN DT NN CC IN PRP VBP DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN FW DT NN VBZ JJ NN IN DT JJ NN,546
2812,suffer with severe allergies asthma so chose this unit based on reviews mentioning improvement with these issues i ran it 24/7 mostly on low for nearly a month and did not notice any improvement if anything it just created a breeze which moved around the dust i q-tipped the filter and found a miniscule amount of dust accumulation i expected to find much more given how dusty my apt is the air did not smell any different although it was a bit cooler for the first day or so i will concede it is very quiet i purchased this to replace a very old air cleaner that seemed to have lost its efficacy however the hb is no more efficient so i could have saved myself the expense although the older unit was very noisy on its lowest setting making it unusable at night,2.0,1.0,1,VB IN JJ NNS NN RB VBD DT NN VBN IN NNS VBG NN IN DT NNS FW VBD PRP CD RB IN JJ IN RB DT NN CC VBD RB VB DT NN IN NN PRP RB VBD DT NN WDT VBD IN DT NN FW FW DT NN CC VBD DT JJ NN IN NN NN FW VBN TO VB RB RBR VBN WRB JJ PRP$ JJ VBZ DT NN VBD RB VB DT JJ IN PRP VBD DT NN NN IN DT JJ NN CC RB FW MD VB PRP VBZ RB JJ FW VBN DT TO VB DT RB JJ NN NN WDT VBD TO VB VBN PRP$ NN RB DT NN VBZ DT RBR JJ IN FW MD VB VBN PRP DT NN IN DT JJR NN VBD RB JJ IN PRP$ JJS NN VBG PRP JJ IN NN,144

2816,this was a great idea my son was thrilled when he opened it christmas morning however he is still to play with it mid january we put it together and the light is so faint you cannot see it in a dark closet i hope that replacing the batteries will fix it however i am hunting the battery type down and so far it looks like i am going to have to pay about fifteen for three batteries i am extremely disappointed do not waste your money on this product even if it ends up working after replacing the batteries it would have cost me close to twenty-five and it is definitively not worth that for products that include batteries there is a life expectancy and by the time the batteries need to be replaced you have played with the toy enough that you can decide whether or not it is worth the investment not this time i guess,1.0,0.0,0,DT VBD DT JJ NN PRP$ NN VBD VBN WRB PRP VBD PRP VBZ NN RB PRP VBZ RB TO VB IN PRP JJ NNP PRP VBD PRP RB CC DT NN VBZ RB JJ PRP MD RB VB PRP IN DT JJ NN FW VBP IN VBG DT NNS MD VB PRP RB FW VBP NN DT NN NN RB CC RB RB PRP VBZ IN FW VBP VBG TO VB TO VB IN CD IN CD NNS FW VBP RB VBN VBP RB VB PRP$ NN IN DT NN RB IN PRP VBZ RP VBG IN VBG DT NNS PRP MD VB VB PRP VB TO CD CC PRP VBZ RB RB JJ IN IN NNS WDT VBP NNS EX VBZ DT NN NN CC IN DT NN DT NNS VBP TO VB VBN PRP VBP VBN IN DT NN RB IN PRP MD VB IN CC RB PRP VBZ IN DT NN RB DT NN FW NN,159
2817,when i got my xbox it came with a copy of sega two thousand gt i really enjoyed that game up to a point namely the point when the difficulty curve shot up dramatically and it was no longer fun to play anymore i e impossible to win forza is light-years beyond that game and i am sure most other games in this genre the learning curve is gradual and you actually end up learning a great deal about auto racing yes it is that real it is a true simulation not just a game there is a massive selection of cars and tracks and many different types of competition events career mode is the most fun as you can win cars and money and spend that money to customize your cars do not spend too much time tricking out your cars though because you will find yourself switching between cars frequently in order to get through all of the different events this can be a real learning experience if you have spent the majority of your time in a fwd car switching to the rwd can be traumatic try the porsche nine hundred and eleven a-class at laguna seca or enter the rotary challenge and try to keep that rx7 on the track luckily there is a free run mode in which you can practice with any car on any track an invaluable aid when you find yourself stumped you can tweak each car's setup right down to the tire pressure spring tension wheel camber gear ratios and all that stuff you really can get lost in this game overall this is a game which will remain interesting for quite some time not good news for your family or any hobbies you will end up neglecting for hours on end i am beginning to hate this game because it is so dang fun i just cannot stop playing darn you microsoft,3.0,1.0,4,WRB FW VBD PRP$ NN PRP VBD IN DT NN IN JJ CD CD NN FW RB VBN IN NN IN TO DT NN RB DT NN WRB DT NN NN VBD RB RB CC PRP VBD RB RB NN TO VB RB FW SYM JJ TO VB NN VBZ JJ IN DT NN CC FW VBP JJ RBS JJ NNS IN DT NN DT VBG NN VBZ JJ CC PRP RB VBP IN VBG DT JJ NN IN NN NN RB PRP VBZ IN JJ PRP VBZ DT JJ NN RB RB DT NN EX VBZ DT JJ NN IN NNS CC NNS CC JJ JJ NNS IN NN NNS NN NN VBZ DT JJS NN IN PRP MD VB NNS CC NN CC VB DT NN TO VB PRP$ NNS VBP RB VB RB JJ NN VBG RP PRP$ NNS RB IN PRP MD VB PRP VBG IN NNS RB IN NN TO VB IN DT IN DT JJ NNS DT MD VB DT JJ NN NN IN PRP VBP VBN DT NN IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN NN NN TO DT NN MD VB JJ VBP DT NN CD CD CC NNS VBP IN NN NN CC VB DT JJ NN CC VB TO VB DT NN IN DT NN RB EX VBZ DT JJ NN NN IN WDT PRP MD VB IN DT NN IN DT NN DT JJ NN WRB PRP VBP PRP VBN PRP MD VB DT NN POS NN RB RB TO DT NN NN NN NN NN NN NN NNS CC PDT DT NN PRP RB MD VB VBN IN DT NN RB DT VBZ DT NN WDT MD VB JJ IN RB DT NN RB JJ NN IN PRP$ NN CC DT NNS PRP MD VB RP VBG IN NNS IN NN FW VBP VBG TO VB DT NN IN PRP VBZ RB JJ NN FW RB MD RB VB VBG JJ PRP VBP,322
