0,i bought this phone on release which was my main motivation for buying a 30.00 screen protector the application of the protector to phone was fine and it worked well i enjoyed the texture and the coating did seem to help with finger prints i put my phone in my pocket prior to going on a twelve mile hike nothing else was in my pocket the phone and screen protector were both pristine.to my shock and gross disappointment i pulled my phone from my pocket after the hike was done to find a huge crack on the screen i had no hard impacts to my side and my pants were loose so the phone could not have been bent i guess the phone it self needs the one star but all i know for certain is that my cracked screen was not protected,1.0,0.0,LS VBD DT NN IN NN WDT VBD PRP$ JJ NN IN VBG DT CD NN NN DT NN IN DT NN TO NN VBD JJ CC PRP VBD RB FW VBD DT NN CC DT NN VBD VB TO VB IN NN NNS FW VB PRP$ NN IN PRP$ NN RB TO VBG IN DT CD NN NN NN RB VBD IN PRP$ NN DT NN CC NN NN VBD DT JJ PRP$ NN CC JJ NN FW VBD PRP$ NN IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN VBD VBN TO VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN FW VBD DT JJ NNS TO PRP$ NN CC PRP$ NNS VBD JJ IN DT NN MD RB VB VBN JJ FW VBP DT NN PRP NN VBZ DT CD NN CC DT FW VB IN JJ VBZ IN PRP$ VBN NN VBD RB VBN,i buy this phone on release which be my main motivation for buy a 30.00 screen protector the application of the protector to phone be fine and it work well i enjoy the texture and the coating do seem to help with finger print i put my phone in my pocket prior to go on a twelve mile hike nothing else be in my pocket the phone and screen protector be both pristine.to my shock and gross disappointment i pull my phone from my pocket after the hike be do to find a huge crack on the screen i have no hard impact to my side and my pants be loose so the phone could not have be bent i guess the phone it self need the one star but all i know for certain be that my crack screen be not protect,143

34,the best summary of this speaker is “ solid ” both in terms of build quality and sound while it ’ s not audiophile level quality i ’ m pleased with the performance and feature set for the price point.the overall look is very nice it ’ s mostly black with some red accents the grill is metal and has a diamond pattern that stands out well without being flashy the control buttons are all on the top edge and are clearly labeled in red a flap on one the side covers the 3.5 mm input jack and the micro usb input port the other side has a loop to attach a lanyard or clip the body is covered in a rubber-like material that feels nice and offers a matte finish to hide fingerprints there are two large non-slip pads on the base that are very effective in keeping this planted all in all no complaints about the overall design and build quality given the price point.it comes in a decent box with a carry case and a charging cord the manual is very brief but covers the basics which are pretty much self-explanatory it does have voice prompts that tell you “ power on ” and “ pairing ” but they are not as obnoxious as other speakers i ’ ve used with voice prompts still i ’ d prefer a simple beep rather than a voice.bluetooth paring was simple and easy and i like that it enters pairing mode automatically without having to push any buttons i had no problems maintaining a connection at twenty feet.the sound quality is quite good at low to moderate volume levels the high end is pretty crisp the mid range is clear and there is ample bass however it gets pretty harsh when you turn it up although this has a volume range that ’ s wider than you normally get with a bluetooth speaker this is not a speaker that likes to get pushed to the max but in all fairness i ’ ve yet to find a speaker in this price range that maintains good fidelity when maxed out.for the price point about thirty this warrants a 4.5 star rating based on it ’ s performance and feature set i ’ ll round up to five stars since the overall aesthetics black and red appeal to me plus the fact that the buttons are so clearly labeled which is becoming rare on lower-end products well worth considering if you ’ re looking for a easily portable speaker with solid performance sample provided for review a 4.5 star rating based on it ’ s performance and feature set i ’ ll round up to five stars since the overall

' be not audiophile level quality i ' m pleased with the performance and feature set for the price point.the overall look be very nice it ' s mostly black with some red accent the grill be metal and have a diamond pattern that stand out well without be flashy the control button be all on the top edge and be clearly label in red a flap on one the side cover the 3.5 mm input jack and the micro usb input port the other side have a loop to attach a lanyard or clip the body be cover in a rubber-like material that feel nice and offer a matte finish to hide fingerprint there be two large non-slip pad on the base that be very effective in keep this plant all in all no complaint about the overall design and build quality give the price point.it come in a decent box with a carry case and a charge cord the manual be very brief but cover the basics which be pretty much self-explanatory it do have voice prompt that tell you `` power on '' and `` pairing '' but they be not as obnoxious as other speaker i ' ve use with voice prompt still i ' d prefer a simple beep rather than a voice.bluetooth pare be simple and easy and i like that it enter pair mode automatically without have to push any button i have no problem maintain a connection at twenty feet.the sound quality be quite good at low to moderate volume level the high end be pretty crisp the mid range be clear and there be ample bass however it get pretty harsh when you turn it up although this have a volume range that ' be wider than you normally get with a bluetooth speaker this be not a speaker that like to get push to the max but in all fairness i ' ve yet to find a speaker in this price range that maintain good fidelity when max out.for the price point about thirty this warrant a 4.5 star rating base on it ' be performance and feature set i ' ll round up to five star since the overall aesthetics black and red appeal to I plus the fact that the button be so clearly label which be become rare on lower-end product well worth consider if you ' re look for a easily portable speaker with solid performance sample provide for review a 4.5 star rating base on it ' be performance and feature set i ' ll round up to five star since the overall aesthetics black and red appeal to I plus the fact that the button be so clearly label which be become rare on lower-end product well worth consider if you ' re look

43,i purchased this game in clearance at target after playing ultimate destruction for the gamecube and loving it might i add i had high expectations that this game would be very similar but with next gen graphics etc but boy was i wrong.this game is not even sort of bad it is absolutely awful first off the thing i loved about ultimate destruction was the diversity of combat and unlockable moves and the ability to combine sweet combos to make massive destruction hence the name on your enemies the combat in this game does not even come close remember those awesome moves like turning a bus into a surf board or running up the face of a skyscraper and pile driving off of it into the ground below forget it you will not find any of that here except for clunky tedious what feels like broken and unfinished combat i could go on forever about how much of an absolute garbage pile this game is but lets move on to the story and missions.now in all fairness ultimate destruction was not perfect but man was it a blast you actually felt like you had the power of the hulk at your finger tips i enjoyed the story a lot as well it felt like it was coming straight from one of the comic books sure a couple of the missions were a bit blah but even the worst missions in ultimate destruction look like flawless pieces of art compared to the garbage in this game.it s difficult for me to even comprehend in my mind and interpret it accurately in words that is how awful the gameplay story is in this game to better make you understand i actually forced myself to try and finish this game and i could not bring myself to do it it feels written scripted by a two year old the missions are so bland go here or go beat up those guys that you want to stick a magnum and blow your head off now to defend my statement many games have those sort of tedious missions which i would not have minded but add tedious missions onto god-awful gameplay mechanics that make you want to drill your eyeballs out and you got yourself a jolly good time.my only question is how how does a game where you get to play as the freaking hulk turn out so bad i have no idea ... all they would have had to do is copy ultimate destruction with hd graphics and i would have been the happiest person alive.heed my warning or ignore it but i pity the fool who pays ninety dollars for this game i cannot even believe this putrid pile of poop is even selling this high as for me i am going to pull out my gamecube and play ultimate destruction again i advise you ro so the same,0.0,0.0,FW VBN DT NN IN NN IN NN IN VBG JJ NN

169,"originally released in one thousand , nine hundred and seventy-six get closer is the 8th proper seals crofts album and incredibly despite its gold-selling status as well as the presence of the top ten soft rock staple that is the title track it is taken over thirty years for this album in full to get cd release in the us if not the whole world if you read through the original album liner notes before listening you would come across some seemingly discouraging signs only eight songs with a total duration of less than thirty-five minutes plus an album-closer that runs well over six minutes a closer look and you will see two songs copyrighted one thousand , nine hundred and sixty-nine and an additional one copyrighted one thousand , nine hundred and seventy-two and in fact the opening song sweet green fields had already been recorded way back in the 60s by the knickerbockers famed for their infamous beatles knockoff lies all of this inescapably gets one thinking that jim dash were probably burning out and or under pressure to crank out an album before the start of a tour and or to meet a warners brothers deadline maybe they were under pressure hardly an unlikely scenario in the record business but despite all of that get closer somehow ends up being the most consistently engaging album seals crofts made during their 1969-1980 run a fantastic album that is carefully crafted flawlessly professional yet still passionately sung and played the opening sweet green fields is a marvelous epic with edgy verses a feel-good chorus and a soaring bridge section it is followed by the title track--the odds that anyone reading this has never heard the song is so slim that i suppose i just as well refrain from comment but suffice it to say that it is a great soft rock anthem regardless of how sick to death of it you might be and understandably so and carolyn willis co-lead vocals help underline its gospel leaning the next track red long ago is another brilliant epic with a simple yet irresistibly dreamy looping piano line played by david paich andbracing dynamics the closing track on side one in vinyl terms provides some respite from all the preceeding drama with a relatively short and lightweight albeit really fun and catchy tune called goodbye old buddies which was written by parker mcgee the same guy who wrote i would really love to see you tonight and other songs for england dan john ford coley ); mcgee recorded his own version of this song for his lone self-titled album also released in one thousand , nine hundred and seventy-six but the seals crofts version with a typically excellent lead vocal spotlight from dash crofts is easily the preferrable version side two opens with baby blue which starts off sounding like a rather pedestrian 70s mid-tempo pop-rock ballad albeit pleasant but then goes on to achieve greatness with its out-of-nowhere wistful yet bouncy bridge section punctuated by a memorable lead guitar line million dollar horse despite somewhat strange lyrics is a beautiful heartstring-tugging ballad as is the poetic do not fail which is even more poignant it is somewhat incredible to think that james seals had do not fail waiting in the wings for five years before it finally appearing on album maybe they would tried to record it earlier but were unsatisfied with the results especially considering some of the lesser compositions that were used on earlier albums the album ends with passing thing which has some french lyrics not to mention a lovely melody although it is mostly another one of their instrumental showcases giving jim dash a chance to duel it out on acoustic guitar and mandolin respectively only on this final track does it really feel like jim dash were padding the album to compensate for lack of material but it is still a thoroughly enjoyable piece displaying all-around impeccable musicianship and it is interesting to hear the honest-to-goodness drum machine that crops up on the second half of the track yes they did indeed have them back in the 70s although it hardly sounds like what you have probably come to associate drum machines with in other words they are hardly foreshadowing 80s dance-pop or 90s electronica as usual get closer was produced by louie shelton and if the album sounds a bit more steely dan-ish than you remember that is easily explained by the fact that seals crofts were using many of the same players including larry carlton guitar jim horn saxophone and future toto members david paich keyboards and jeff porcaro drums rhino flashback has provided a long overdue cd reissue of this must-have album although in typical fashion of their flashback division rhino has unfortunately skimped on the packaging no musician credits etc although in compensation the list price is ultra-low in the end this is a great album from a great duo that has been known to get an unkind and unfair bad rap over the years get closer is seals

189,"disclaimer i have had this lens for about three days now if anything changes i will update this review otherwise you can assume that i am still just as happy as i am now.before buying this i looked at every available uwa on the market for my nikon d3200 i checked the reviews including the ratings on dxomark's website great technical reference but it is all lab and no field ratings i found various professional reviews and read virtually every user review i could find in amazon and google shopping i looked at nikon's 10-24 mm the other tokina uwa's and other maker's lenses as well of all the lenses this one had the most positive and least negative reviews above all possibly tied with the tokina 11-16 the 11-16 is one f-stop faster and no-one had any autofocusing issues as were reported with some of the 11-24 s however no autofocus issues were reported on the 11-28 either on the nikon 10-24 most complaints were about vignetting and softness at the edges although some disliked the plastic instead of metal mount and that it is made in red china the fact that it costs around 1,000 it can now be found for about seven hundred and fifty not only motivated me to look a different lenses but frankly speaking ... given the reviews i expected more for that kind of money so i decided to take a chance on this lens instead of the 11-16 or 10-24.great choice :) i have shot about sixty pictures so far and this lens absolutely performs to my expectations and a little above to be honest fyi i shoot strictly raw and post process using dxolabs excellent optics pro software standard edition.sharpness is excellent from edge to edge regardless of zoom setting i have seen no sign of fringing even when shooting in dim light at f4 with a 1/15 shutter speed using iso four hundred and even iso one thousand low-light noise and graininess is the same as i get from all my other lenses at the same settings in fact ... i would say that the sharpness of this lens compares very favorably to my nikon prime 2.8 35mm which i absolutely love autofocus works exactly as advertised quite well and quickly but is slightly noisier than my nikons are i did however switch from single-point focus to multipoint during uwa shots and i think that the focusing of the lens was a bit quicker that way but that could simply be a subjective reaction.when zooming or using manual focus the feel of the lens is precise and smooth the shift from autofocus to manual is done by pulling the focus ring toward you which takes some getting used to ... but is brilliant no need to feel around for switches and hope you are not getting the vr switch instead of the a m switch on a nikon the barrel length does not change during zoom it is all internal and there is no zoom creep if you point the lens down or up i do wish that this lens had a vr feature but then again neither does my 35mm from nikon nor does the 10-24 mm from nikon either for me this means that i will need to bring my monopod when shooting uwa interior shots inside historical buildings and mansions where flash is forbidden but honestly that is no big deal i did not have vr during my film days so this was a common requirement.colors are accurate and well saturated i see no vignetting at any setting distortion is exactly what you would expect from a uwa and is easily corrected via dxolabs opticspro which has a module for this lens or you can use their stand-alone viewpoint product which costs less but gives you greater control over perspective corrections note viewpoint only handles jpgs so you will still need to have a post-processing software to export your raws you can also use adobe's lightroom to fix perspectives as well but that is a completely manual process if you shoot raw and do post-processing you really should take a look at dxolab's products especially opticspro.lastly the lens has a solid professional feel to it unlike the plastic nikons and some other brands it is reminiscent of my old series one lenses back from my film days ... there is no dust blowback from zooming into the camera since the zoom is internal and the docking collar is steel not plastic which is nice because it reduces concerns about fragility when spending five hundred on a lens.to sum it up this is probably the best uwa lens out there running at f four especially when you look at the cost i would buy this again :) if you want to see some of my tests go to mercerpics at smugmug and look for the tokina test gallery.postscript i took the lens with me today for a visit to my seven month old grandson along with my 35mm prime nikon lens now this should be no surprise to anyone ... but inside without a flash f four was a tough aperture to use due to slow shutter speeds at iso one hundred having said that about half the shots i took using the 12-28 still came out very sharp especially when shooting at 28mm i switched to my 35mm and ran it at f 2.8 simply because my grandson is a very active baby and i was getting too much motion blur with the f four tokina if you are planning on using the tokina inside without a flash you need still subjects and a monopod if shooting low iso s of course otherwise boost the iso which is not really a big deal on the new generation of dslr's they do a great job of keeping detail and reducing noise it is kind of hard to see a difference between iso one hundred and iso four hundred unless you are pixel peeping :) the reason i mention this is because when i use vr nikon lenses it is like picking up two f-stops ... and it is easy to forget that is not the case with either the tokina or the nikon prime lenses since i am planning on using this lens for inside architecture shots in somewhat dim historical homes running this through it is paces at extreme parameters in advance was a good idea outside shots in the sun were unbelievably sharp and clear fyi :) still loving this lens",3.0,1.0,NN FW VBP VBN DT NN IN IN CD NNS RB IN NN
