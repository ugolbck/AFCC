The Apple Watch actually offers quite a bit of utility as far as wrist adornments go, but it is first and foremost something to look good. It was never meant to replace an iPhone so people need to stop evaluating it on that basis. As for rapid, pervasive obsolescence of your latest gadget, it's an unfortunate side-effect of Moore's Law. You don't have to buy the latest and greatest if you don't want to, but a lot of people want to.I will likely end up with an Apple Watch for the following ironic reason: I haven't worn a watch in years because I have had a phone in my pocket that already does the one thing a watch does: tell time. Now, with an Apple Watch, I'll get the convenience of telling the time without having to get a hand free to get my phone out of my pocket and still have a device that gives me access to much of the stuff I turn to my iPhone for already.

The cost-sharing model on which medicare was established, for instance, was fairly swiftly abandoned by the federal government, leaving provinces increasingly holding the bag for health care funding, which now eats up about fifty percent of provincial revenues in some jurisdictions.

Pope Francis is doing a great PR job for the church without really deviating from the Church's overall theological position. The church needs some recharging, and he's doing his best to provide it without deviating from core theology. He was a priest and bishop in South America, and saw a kind of poverty there that few popes (all Europeans, and until recently, all from Italy) have ever seen. Christianity - for all the focus the Church has placed on these things in the past few decades - was not meant to be about sexual orientation, abortion issues, and other modern day preoccupations. Its original imperative was about love and compassion, with a strong injunction to help the poor, as well as a focus on the life of the spirit versus the material. In focusing on poverty and questioning the rampant materialism of the modern age, he's going back to the roots of the religion (sadly mostly lost in the last 2000 years). As for environmentalism, why not? This I think is part of the great PR he's doing, there's nothing controversial about it from the Church's perspective, and it's a very hot topic these days.

They have been ordaining women as priests for twenty years now, along with other Provinces of the Anglican Communion, and now the number of women in theological colleges preparing for ordination are well outnumbering men. The result being that men are leaving the church in droves. In addition to this women are getting all the senior appointments, and come from a background of, in many cases, militant feminism.

Perhaps 'line in the sand' was the wrong simile (or expression). I'm just pointing out that everyone gets to a point at which they're comfortable with the way they do things. There's no reason to embrace new technology if what you have and are used to does what you want it to. But there's also nothing wrong with wanting to do things 'the new way' because we all did things in new ways at some point in our lives. I'm not much younger than you I suspect since my eldest is only a few years younger than yours but I think I might still be more open to 'the latest thing'.,yes,1,1,1,1,1,"

As I lay in Emergency the night I was admitted, I had my iPod Classic (160 gb) with me, and was listening to it. An orderly came by to check on me, and when he saw it he said 'That's really old school' (it's about 8 years old). And I - who remember when a Walkman was a marvel - thought how odd it was that something so relatively new and amazing was, just a few years later, almost obsolete. How obsolete? Well, Apple has stopped making them. Think about it: they made something that did just one thing and did it brilliantly, allowing users to store an incredible amount of music in a small portable device, but now that's gone, as they try to sell us on other gadgets that yes, will store music, but only a fraction of what the Classic could hold. Like Elizabeth Renzetti, I get by just fine with a Blackberry (for basic communication). I also wear a wristwatch (a Citizen Eco-Drive; never needs batteries), and for entertainment use my iPod Classic. When the Classic packs in I'll only be able to replace it with something that either a) holds a fraction of what the Classic can and/or b) does a whole lot of other things I don't want or need.

And very stressful. The tech revolution is like all revolutions before it. It began with idealism, hope and awesome innovations. Then came the disruptions to the status quo. The arts have suffered dreadfully. Recent reports show incomes for musicians, writers, and artists are way down from a decade ago. But the Tech Rebels scoff at this and call us to look to the Brave New World of Free Information, Art, and Music. One might ask where those who once were paid to write and sing will find money to eat, but that just makes you a reactionary and a counter-revolutionary. Food can now be printed on one's 3-D printer, says the Comrade of Tech. I'm tempted to scoff, 'Let them eat Bits & Bytes', but that is a trademarked name. I listened to Douglas Coupland, who is sounding like a tech party hack more and more, talk about not being able to remember what it was like to not have the Internet. He has a Wired Brain now. And he offered an anecdote to prove it, only the anecdote proved to be vague and flat and unpersuasive (like everything Mr Coupland has written after Generation X).My library has ditched half its collection in the past two years in the naive belief we'll soon be fully digital and want to be fully digital. But the avid readers I know still prefer paper to screens, except when travelling. And though I love my Netflix, streaming is ephemeral with limited selection and brief windows of opportunity. Revolutions, as we know, do not lead to utopian worlds where everyone is free and equal. There's an Orwellian perversity to Tech Rebel's claims that Net Neutrality will bring about an Earthly Paradise when what we really see is a move to One Bookstore, One Taxi Dispatcher, One Encyclopedia, and One Index to the Whole World. The Robber Barons of the Gilded Age have returned and joining them are the Silicon Sultans of the Information Age. And we're called Users, like a drug addict, and yet we are the ones being used. The Bread and Circuses of the Internet keep us entertained while wealth and power becomes concentrated into the hands of a very select few. Aldous Huxley, Douglas Adams, and Neil Postman had it right. We are amusing ourselves to death. And I'm reminded of that scene in Ninotchka where Melvyn Douglas turns on the radio while romancing Greta Garbo and says his radio is 'a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in, they tell you there's a new model out.'Who's watching the smart watchmen?",yes,0.6923,"2

The lawsuit also challenges Uber’s practice of telling passengers that the gratuity is included and not to tip the drivers, even though you are not getting a tip!! We won a major victory on March 11, 2015, when the judge overseeing the case, Judge Edward M. Chen, of the federal district court in San Francisco, denied Uber’s motion for summary judgment! In his decision, the judge agreed with many of our arguments about why Uber drivers may be properly classified as employees. Click here to read the court’s decision. Under the court’s order, the case will go to trial before a jury. See the news stories below for reports on the ruling. The next step in the case will now be for the court to decide class certification, which would define the scope of the case and which drivers can be covered under it. The court has set a hearing on class certification for August 6, 2015. We expect that Uber will argue that most drivers are bound by an arbitration clause, which prevents them from benefiting from a class action case in court. In another case (which challenges Uber’s background checks), the same judge who is presiding over our case ruled that Uber’s arbitration clause is unconscionable and unenforceable. However, Uber has appealed that decision. In the event that the arbitration clause is ultimately enforced, we plan to file individual arbitration cases for drivers who may be bound by the arbitration clause. So if you did not opt out of Uber's arbitration clause within 30 days of accepting the agreement (and most drivers did not), please CONTACT US so that we can add you to our list of drivers to pursue individual arbitration if we need to do that, so that you can be assured of being covered by the result we obtain. If you accepted an Uber contract within the last 30 days, you can still opt out of the arbitration clause by emailing optout@uber.com and saying you want to opt out of the arbitration clause. IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN IF WE WIN THE CASE, YOU MAY NOT RECOVER ANYTHING FROM IT UNLESS YOU CONTACT US TO SIGN UP FOR ARBITRATION. SO PLEASE EMAIL ELIZABETH LOPEZ, AT elopez@llrlaw.com, TO SIGN UP FOR ARBITRATION, IN THE EVENT THAT WE NEED TO FILE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS FOR DRIVERS. MORE THAN A THOUSAND DRIVERS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED US TO JOIN OUR LIST. In a recent decision, the California Labor Commissioner ruled that an Uber driver was indeed an employee, not an independent contractor, and ordered Uber to reimburse the driver for her expenses. This is the same remedy we are seeking for all Uber drivers in the class action lawsuit. This decision was a great result and may be helpful to our lawsuit. We were very pleased to learn that the California Labor Commissioner agrees that Uber is acting as an employer. However, Uber has appealed the decision, which will be reviewed de novo in court, and so its impact on the class action case is not yet clear. We filed this case on behalf of Uber drivers across the country. In an early ruling, the court agreed with us that the case could proceed on behalf of drivers nationwide. In a later ruling, however, the judge changed his mind and limited the case to drivers in California. We think this decision was incorrect and we plan to appeal it. But meanwhile, if you have driven for Uber anywhere in the United States, and did not opt out of the arbitration clause within 30 days of accepting Uber’s licensing agreement, PLEASE CONTACT US to obtain a form to return to us so that we can pursue an individual arbitration claim for you, in the event that we have to pursue these claims individually, rather than through the class action. If you have any questions, feel free to call or email Shannon Liss-Riordan, the lead attorney representing the Uber drivers, or her paralegal assistant, Elizabeth Lopez, at (617) 994-5800, at elopez@llrlaw.com, or sliss@llrlaw.com.Attorney Liss-Riordan and her firm have represented thousands of tipped employees, and employees who have been misclassified as independent contractors, all around the country.

And this lack of competition not only hurts all citizens but in the end it severely damages our competitiveness in the global economy by constantly putting us behind the 8 ball. Toronto should do as Santiago Chile did in the 80's, and that is to open up the taxi market by stripping the government red tape for licenses and making it much cheaper and easier for those who want to drive. At first there was a predictable explosion of taxis on the streets in Santiago, but over a relatively short period of time the market itself dictated the amount of taxis that would survive. In other words, the free market found its natural and proper equilibrium. Uber is too good a service to ignore, it's here to stay.

But when Hillary became SoS a few years ago she proclaimed with great hubris Asia Pivot! What this means is the U.S. will install massive military forces in the region to contain & control China.

Philippines previous president asked it to pass an opinion on the matter of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), not border or sovereignty. Specifically, what size of an island qualified for EEZ. The Tribunal reports that NO island or sandbar or reclaimed islands currently in the SCS qualify for EEZ. It also defined what size will qualify. That's it. No islands built or claimed by all parties - China, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia is an EEZ and therefore not a basis for border. That's the opinion for this body. The meaning is simply that they can build bigger islands to fit the EEZ definition, or just go sit down and work out a border solution. China is willing to talk but not with the U.S. inserting itself in the matter. The new Philippine president agreed and they will begin the talk. Once they formed a framework others may join to effect a solution. This of course is very bad news for American war mongers and Asian Pivoters.

At some point we need to wake up. This isn't about some segmented group that needs more cash thrown at it. They received all the benefits of modern welfare society and they still want to kill us. When it was some impoverished farmer in Afghanistan that hated us for drone striking his kids, I could get the left's argument that this drove him to radicalism. These aren't such people in Belgium. They are the people that have been given every possible opportunity by the West, and they still want to kill us due to the indoctrination they receive in their cultural centers and mosques. So I dismiss the author's view that these people are held against their will in some slum without benefits, simply not true. The author is correct that the political and security instability in Belgium allowed radicalism to grow unchecked, but it wasn't for a lack of welfare for these people.

In short, Brussels is the shining light of left-wing big government. And yet all of this government cannot protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.

I was born with plain, white flesh so my head and hands sticking out of the shoulders-to-toes garment were white, too. I am not saying that I was picked on because I was wearing Moroccan clothing and could have been mistaken for a north African, but that is entirely possible. To satisfy political correctness, I will add that the cash payment I received for the van was in Belgian money and not Canadian, but I do clearly recall how much the cash converted to in Canadian funds. The stupid part is that my spouse and I let that police officer cart us around without protesting or making any attempt to escape! He first took us to 'the station' in the back seat of his police car so he could contact the relatives in Canada we named to arrange for plane tickets back (we arrived in Europe with one-way tickets and, after travelling throughout Europe and north Africa for two years, had run out of sufficient funds to buy them so we planned to work in England for awhile).

A lot of the debate were not about addressing the real issues. It was about elites trying to make themselves feel good by explaining how stupid and backwards people who wanted to leave are. In the case of Trump, Michael Moore warned everyone by painting Trump as dangerous, and his fear was most vocalized when he warned his fellow progressives not to attack his followers but to show why Trump is just conning them. Moore sees Trump's supporters as decent people who have legitimate problems that are not being addressed, and attacking them as backwards deplorable irredeemable was the worse strategy possible. But what did the progressives do? They said only stupid racist hateful people support Trump. It was almost like Trump successfully pulled off an Alinsky tactic by baiting the establishment progressives into overreacting and making his supporters even more convinced that he was going to blow the whole place up.I think Moore's plan was difficult to pull off because neither Hillary nor Moore or just about anyone else had the ability to connect to the rust belt and hurting 'deplorables' the same way Trump could --- it's all about people skills.

I got the second highest up plus vote on the day on the G&M. For six months I have been saying that the people I knew in the USA felt a distinct disconnect with DC just like the UK had with Brussels. The know it all Liberal Democrats are and were out of touch with the general populace of the 'flyover states' and Main Street USA has spoken. In recent days Obama showed his true colours as an out of touch president who tied his legacy coat tails to a nominee who was flawed in the publics view. Thursday morning will be an interesting meeting at the Whitehouse with Trump viewing the new real estate. I know many businessmen who have had past dealings with Trump and his word is his bond in their words and he is a stand up guy. He will surround himself with advent professionals and will most likely be a great president. His acceptance speech shows that he will now be a committed bridge maker. Chuck Todd of NBC was the only guy last night that got it early last night and spoke about a massive un polled demographic. I look forward to seeing CNNs lead pollster eat a bug on TV today like he said he would if Trump won. Maybe some of these guys should move their offices west of the Hudson to where real people live as Chuck Todd said last night. I have to say that Trudeau showed well thought restraint in not saying anything negative about Trump and there are lots of world leaders in Europe that will have to back track on their public comments. He may not be a great president for Canada but that is not his job. W5 on the weekend showed a great man in the street USA Divided show and it was great journalism diving head long into parts of Ohio that most journalists did not tried.

If Globe writers are asking themselves why this outcome is so different than what they wanted it is because these writers don't carry nearly the influence they think they do.,yes,1,1,1,1,1,"

Trump is now confirmed elected POTUS by overwhelming electoral votes majority. Also, Republican candidates have won BOTH Senate and House. He also gets to nominate the vacated Supreme Court judge, bringing the Court to his side as well. The Donald is de facto elected Dictator of the U.S.A. He can do as he pleases. Given his style, he WILL do as he pleases. The Donald won despite having NO support from the entire political Establishment, NO support from Big Media, NO support from Big Money, NO support from the War Machine, NO this and NO that. His opponent used the most dirty of tricks, cast him as friend of 'evil' Putin, which he just smile. See, the Donald being the ultimate outsider knows a whole lot the big political machine that ran America for so long does not know. Chief among this is he is on his way to wipe out both the Democrat and Republican parties at the same time! The Donald ran a movement. Hillary ran a rig to construct a dynasty. In a movement it does not matter about the details. You just have to sound right and look right for the mob to follow. Hillary humiliating defeat is entirely by herself. Trump rise to power is completely the result of the failure of not only both parties but presidents since Reagan. One of whom is a war criminal under state protection. With both political parties wiped out, the first shot of the movement already yields a political revolution. The 'swamp' already half drained. His task now is to be a Revolutionary Leader. Turn everything upside down. He will do well to read up on such people in history. Such as George Washington, Napoleon, Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Mussolini, and yes Putin. Putin saved Russia.

Then Mr Trudeau needs to have the same conversation with the premiers. That doesn't necessarily mean getting rid of carbon taxes, but it certainly means making them genuinely revenue neutral. That means returning all the revenue to individuals and corporations in the form of reduced taxes, including corporate taxes and regulatory costs, to maintain competitiveness. That's what economists who proposed carbon taxes originally had in mind, rather than treating carbon taxes as a big sin tax that goes into general revenues for addressing deficits and paying for pet projects, as our governments tend to regard them. Otherwise, we jeopardize Canadian competitiveness and prosperity. Arrogantly and contemptuously dismissing these concerns as not worthy of consideration in comparison to the fate of the earth or whatever will just increase the likelihood of Canada producing its own Trump three or four years from now. For the long term, we need not only to defend the Canada-US free trade agreement, even if it is modified in some way, but to expand our trade connections with other countries. CETA is a good start. However it is also important to grow our own internal market. That means eliminating interprovincial barriers to trade in goods and services. Here Mr Trudeau needs to start knocking some provincial premier heads. And it means increasing Canada's population. The advantage of increased population, so long as it is a productive population that isn't just an overall drain on resources, is that it increases the internal market and makes it less susceptible to the inevitable vicissitudes of foreign trade and isolationist eruptions elsewhere. That's a great advantage the United States and Europe have and Canada lacks. Faced with a situation like Mr Trump's victory, Mr Chretien and Mr Martin would have sat down for some blunt conversations with members of their own party and provincial counterparts , as they did concerning the implications of the deficit for Canadian prosperity. Mr Trudeau needs to show he is made of the same stuff.",yes,1,"1

Here's my view, sitting here in our homeland, not having a vote in the US.Full democracy, allows us all to do and say what we want (short of hatred and racism). My father and uncles, all went to war in WWII to protect that right for all of us today. Most people, in both Canada and the US, have family members who did the same, and some who made the ultimate sacrifice. That America exercised that right yesterday, and other democratic countries have done the same in the past (I am not a fan of Junior Trudeau) is our best strength. As Winston Churchill famously said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.”. None of us have an idea how a Trump Presidency will turn out; but the inescapable fact of the matter is that every American, who wanted to exercise their franchise, had the opportunity yesterday to decide who their President is. It wasn’t all that long ago (Aug 6, 1965), that a guy who many people might have expected wouldn’t support universal suffrage, Lyndon Baines Johnson, passed into law for the US, the Voting Rights Act. In 4 years, if they don’t like his performance, they get to kick Trump out of office. In the meantime, everyone who thinks they are “politically entitled” in the US has a chance to rebuild their favourite system. Just as Lech Walesa upset the communist system in Poland, so today has Donald Trump upset the system of political elites in the USA. This is healthy; this is growth; and this will keep America as the leader of the free world. For a country born of revolution, they have nothing to fear. God bless the United States of America.

The opposition knows this and is not likely to roll back the qualifying age, in spite of their histrionics to the contrary. I'm at a loss though about his point about the surplus. Small or not a surplus is a surplus and better $1.9 billion surplus than deficit.

The tone of the piece is self-congratulatory and questionably factual. Important facts are omitted or skewed in the interest of artificially supporting the author’s point and logic fails.“Europe has failed the refugees”....really. Poor Greece has been inundated with refugees that can't afford to help. Germany accepted 140, 000 refugees in 2015 (not just Syrian), Italy and Sweden 30,000 each, France 20,000. Small Denmark was swamped with 20,000 refugee applications. Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and even Egypt and Iraq have been helping the refugees since the beginning of the crisis (2011). For the most part they permitted Syrians access to their countries and have spent vast amounts of money to support them - some published numbers include Turkey, by the start of December 2014, spent USD 4.5 billion in direct assistance to Syrian and as of mid-2014, tiny Jordan and Lebanon had provided more than US$ 1.2 billion and 1.6 billion respectively. Many refugees are not interested in leaving the region. Millions want to return home once the war is over and would prefer to stay close to home - little interest was shown in immigrating to Canada when they were questioned last year. And as for complaints by the author that “More than 1,000 of the newcomers are living in temporary housing. And we still have a shortage of family doctors, a lack of proper dental care for low-income adults and a lack of subsidized daycare spaces for parents who want to learn English”. How does that differ from the plight faced by many Canadians? Should refugees be somehow afforded a higher priority than citizens? And the comment “University-age refugees, or those who already have foreign degrees, can’t afford our postsecondary system, sending many to low-income jobs instead. What future do refugees have without proper language training, Canadian education or Canadian work experience” pretty much sums up why the refugees don’t want to come to Canada or complain when they get here. Resettlement of refugees is a complex, time consuming undertaking and resource intensive. How is Canada supposed to magically change this experience? It is easy to put these complaints to paper but I see not solutions proposed – and that is the hard part.",yes,1,"2

Rouba Al-Fattal should look at the huge increases in populations in the Middle East and take note of where most of the civil wars are taking place ... in nations where the population has tripled or quadrupled since the 1980s. Huge numbers of people are fighting over territory, though they pretend it has something to do with religion. Nowhere on earth can millions of people cross an isthmus to existing host towns ... where they do not share the values of the hosts ... and demand to be taken in at the expense of the hosts. Demand housing, demand health & dental care, demand education, demand recognition for credentials at face value, demand childcare ... who is paying for all this? Hint: not the refugees. This is a smack in the face to all Canadians, particularly those who never thought it was a good idea to bring these huge families to Canada, preferring to send those funds (for flights to Canada and costly accommodation here) to refugee settlements in Jordan and other zones close to Syria. Instead, we hear more and more demands without any recognition for all the associated costs. Even Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf States do NOT accept refugees, even though they are member states of the UN.I suspect it is this pushy demanding attitude that leads to problems in the Middle East, along with the unsustainable growth in population. Canada has a high unemployment rate and is the participant (usually the victim) in many free trade deals. Globalization, modernization, outsourcing and sophisticated new technologies ensure Canada cannot support a forever growing population.

Professor Yu makes no mention of all the other nations in the world that use 'foreign investment taxes' to ensure globe-trotting foreigners don't hoover up housing stock that could house 'stay-put' citizens. He makes NO mention of China's very restrictive land ownership policies, something that is done to protect real estate for domestic citizens ... and no one calls China 'racist' for doing that. Even the Chinese Ambassador to Canada blamed Canada for not taking steps to control its domestic real estate market. I'm getting rather tired of the convenient use of the 'race lens' everywhere INSIDE Canada because it doesn't play very well elsewhere. Canada is not perfect, but it is probably one of the least racist nations ... except when it comes to First Nations who tend to have been restricted by government decree until recent years. The following article from 2013 tells us that more than half of Toronto's population is NON-white (the target of authors who favour a 'race lens') -- same in Vancouver?: http://www.canadianbusiness.com/blogs-and-comment/a-fascinating-new-map-of-torontos-ethnic-distribution/ It also identifies the primary source countries for immigration as the Philippines, India, and China. What are the current populations of the primary source nations for Canadian immigrants? As of June 30, 2015, China had the largest population at 1.362 billion followed by India at 1.252 billion with the Philippines coming in at 100, 699,000. Populations of various nations can be found at http://populationpyramid.net/world/2015/ If we are going to talk about skin colour as if it is the DEFINING point for a nation, let’s be completely honest about the place of white skin (a 'trick' of melanin contained in all human skins) in the world. White is the true minority colour in this global human mix. Canada receives large numbers of immigrants from homogeneous nations where being white is a rarity; yet, Canada is home to a very mixed population of 35,939,000. Within the context of world populations (particularly immigrant source nations), the number of 'white' people is miniscule. Many parts of Canada are trying to 'resemble' the populations of the entire world. Yet, NOWHERE ELSE in the world does that happen. Immigrant source nations are certainly NOT trying to resemble Canada, or attract ‘white’ people because they feel they MUST be more ‘diverse’, though 'Homo sapiens sapiens' simply describes the entire human race as ONE single species.

The Chinese government has created a hostile environment both in terms of politics and human rights. The majority of Chinese want to leave the country, which is not equal nor free. So why has Canada been tasked with the responsibility as a safe haven for Chinese nationals, and their money, at the expense of Canadians, Canadian tax payers, and the quality of our lives? 3) The Citizens of Vancouver and of Canada, in general, are what gives these properties their value. We are a fair and equal society where human rights and the rule of law rein. We are not bogged down by corruption, government suppression nor a vast indifference to each other. We have dialogue and free speech, open government and democratic institutions, and an enormous acceptance and healthy curiosity for what is different. Our behaviour gives these properties value! This country is not at war with another country nor itself. Why should the citizens who built and are building this country be put at a disadvantage, in terms of finance and quality of life, to accommodate those who have little to nothing to do with this city or country. Personally, I don't think my behaviour and my actions should put me at a disadvantage to promote the inability of Chinese nationals to reform their country. 4) If a foreign entity eg. state, business, or individual were to impose their ideologies on another, or exacerbate the inequality in that country the term colonialism would be used to describe their actions. Then why shouldn't their be some means to correct this? 5) Unlike the Head-tax, this tax does not target any one nationality.",yes,1,"1

What I did not like about Clinton the sense I got from her of 'entitlement', that the office was hers for the taking - and not just from her days as Secretary of State, or as a Senator, or from having been First Lady - it struck me, watching a documentary about the US presidential candidates that Clinton had her eyes set on 'the Office' from the time that she had been profiled in LIFE magazine at her College graduation. That uniquely American sense of 'Manifest Destiny' is not attractive - particularly when someone's asking for your help to achieve it. Now that's just my perception, but I believe that same arrogance was what led her (and her team) not to worry about the signals they'd received that they could lose votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Those states were lost by the thinnest of margins, and still, as it has been pointed out, Clinton won the popular vote. I felt that the 'feminist icon' trope was also odd, like a relic from a previous generation. I'm a man, working in a traditional male field (engineering) but I've always accepted and supported my female colleagues and managers. I will agree that the bemused tolerance of the masses was too easily interpreted as tacit approval of Trump's antics, until it was too late. I also agree that groups of people whose attitudes and behaviour sequestered them (rightfully) to an underclass in our society, have been emboldened. I doubt that they will remain that way for long. Nothing that Donald Trump can do will elevate these fools, or make their angry lives truly better.

Remember, Mr. Trump chewed his way through 16 other Republican contenders, most of them men, and probably all of them technically more qualified than he. Much of that spectacle occurred long before it was evident that Ms. Clinton would be the Democratic nominee. You assume, incorrectly, that America is a progressive society. While there are progressive segments, what this election demonstrated is the opposite. Sexism, racism and xenophobia are alive and doing very well there, particlarly in the Republican caucus. Further, politics is relentlessly self-serving, at the personal and party level. Also, especially since 2008, economic growth has disproportionately benefitted the wealthy. (That's a big issue on its own, but its relevance here is that the privileged are making the economic and political decisions to their own benefit while the underclass is falling farther behind.) For example, how can America's election campaign funding model be considered fair and democratic? Mr. Trump has ably exploited all these issues. Ms. Clinton, besides being a woman, also became the poster-person for the status quo. In effect her biggest asset - her vast experience - became a liability. Perhaps Bernie Sanders would have been a better adversary, not because he's a guy, but because he also was speaking out about the injustices being suffered by less privileged Americans. Those arguments worked very well for his popularity too, particularly among young women. And, since we're here, Ms. Clinton wasn't so overwhelmingly popular among those younger women. While one can argue with some validity that some women are against a female President, I'd venture that for many of them, other issues are in play. While it is fair to speak out against sexism (and racism and xenophobia) in America and elsewhere, my worry now is that Americans have elected a sorcerer's apprentice. How much damage can this apprentice do? I worry about increasing instability in eastern Europe (in particular). I worry about war over the South China Sea. I worry that the global ecosphere is in deeper trouble now, due to Mr Trump's inappropriate policies on climate change, habitat destruction and unsustainable, profit-driven, wasteful consumption of resources.

I'm going to tell my daughter what I told the two demoralized young female cashiers at the grocery store: That having watched Hillary's career for 20 years, having looked at her major donors (monied interests), having read some of the leaked emails, having looked at her positions regarding due process for accused men, having read accounts from former staff (from SS to aides to housekeepers) that she has a hair trigger temper and a habit of domestic violence and abuse of underlings, I would never have voted for her. Not in a million years. I'd have voted in Peewee Herman over her. I'm going to tell my daughter that having a vagina does not make someone a good person, that being a skilful rhetorician doesn't necessarily make what someone says valid, and that being diplomatic and a convincing liar doesn't make a person honest. I'm going to tell my daughter that being sad because a woman didn't get in this time is silly, and I'll point her to some genuine examples of women who achieved great things and never sacrificed their honor or principles to do so, and never had to play 'the vagina card'--people like Anne Cools, Erin Pizzey, Karen Decrow, and even Marie Henein. I'll tell my daughter that when Marie Henein spoke with Peter Mansbridge about her defence of Jian Ghomeshi, I watched the video ten times, transfixed by her adherence to the principles of law, of justice, of due process, of presumption of innocence, of the right to a vigorous defence, and her awareness of the power of the state to utterly destroy the lives of people, innocent or not, if it is allowed to act without constraint. And I'll tell her about all the feminist women who declared Marie Henein to be a 'traitor to her gender' for the crime of doing her job passionately and competently, and that it's this same mentality that has convinced some women that the results of this election are proof of misogyny. I don't care about whether Hillary's a good mother, or whether she held her grandbaby enough. I don't care about whether she's 'cuddly'. I care about her competency, her honesty and her integrity, and from more than 20 years of observing her actions, I found her lacking. She's a corrupt career politician who's in the pocket of monied interests, who has been irresponsible with classified information, whose inaction has led to deaths, and who only seems to be good at courting massive donations from foreign dictatorships and the banking elite, and commanding speaking fees in the hundreds of thousands, all while claiming to be the voice of ordinary American women.

While I find Trump to be completely abhorrent, in essence, he has only served to reflect a society that is deeply divided and very frustrated. He has served to illuminate and give a platform to misogynistic, racist & isolationist/nationalist idealism. It is a frightening state of affairs here in America. That said, Hillary Clinton DID win the popular vote. One of the biggest problems in America is the electoral college. Now, twice in recent history, two extremely qualified candidates have lost the election b/c of the electoral college: Hillary Clinton & Al Gore. We need to let the people’s true voices be heard. We need to amend the constitution and abolish the electoral college. It was established by the founding fathers of America to ensure equal representation for each state, but it is now completely antiquated and detrimental to America. In fact, I can think of a few constitutional amendments that need to be abolished …starting with the 2nd amendment!!! (But, I digress)2) I somewhat agree with Henein when she writes, “She lost because she was a woman”. While I agree that it was one of the factors, I certainly did not vote for Hillary b/c she was a woman and I hope no one else did either! I voted for Hillary b/c I have the utmost respect for her 30 years of public service, her balanced thoughtful approach to making decisions and b/c she is the most qualified candidate to have EVER run for the highest office in America! In fact, it frustrated me when Hillary kept referring to “the glass ceiling”. While I understand that it is not the case right now, every women should be judged on her merit alone….not the color of her pantsuit. I am confident that within our lifetime we will be addressing a “Madam President”. Why? ...Because we are raising woman that BELIEVE they CAN be president.

The morning my children and I woke up to the horrible reality of Trump winning, my 14 year-old daughter asked me how it happened how a woman could be hated so much that a racist, sexist bully could be the preferable choice over Ms. Clinton. Barely able to explain it to myself, I struggled to find the words I needed to tell her that her voice, her vote, her existence mattered in the face of such insanity taking place in the U.S. Days later, I'm still trying to find the answer and I appreciate your take on it. If Trump was a protest vote, then clearly Americans chose to protest civility, inclusion, reason, kindness and collaboration. More than ever before in my life (and yes, I was born in the States but have lived here since I was 10), I'm grateful to be a Canadian, but I'm not sure I will ever be able to explain this presidency to my daughter or my two sons.
